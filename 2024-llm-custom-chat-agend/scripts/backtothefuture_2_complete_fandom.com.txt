Back To The Future II

Jennifer: How about a ride, mister?

Marty: Jennifer. Oh, man, are you a sight for sore eyes! Let me look at you.

Jennifer. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week.

Marty: I haven't.

Jennifer: Are you okay? Is everything all right?

Marty: Oh, yeah. Everything's great.

[the DeLorean screeches to a halt in the driveway as it hits a garbage can]

Doc: Marty! You've gotta come back with me!

Marty: Where?

Doc: Back to the future!

Marty: Wait a minute. What are you doin’, Doc?

[Doc takes some garbage from the can and puts it into Mr. Fusion]

Doc: I need fuel. Go ahead. Quick! Get in the car.

Marty: No, no, no. Look, Doc, I just got here, okay? Jennifer's here. We're gonna take the new truck for a spin.

Doc: Well, bring her along. This concerns her, too.

Marty: Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talkin’ about? What happens to us in the future? What, do we become assholes or somethin’?

Doc: No, no, no. You and Jennifer both turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty. Something has gotta be done about your kids.

Marty: Hey, Doc, we better back up. We don't have enough road to get up to 88.

Doc: Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.

Biff: [runs outside] Say, Marty! Marty! Marty, I wanted to show you these new matchbooks for my auto detailing I had printed up. [Sees the DeLorean fly off] A flying DeLorean? What the hell is goin’ on here?

[Doc is wearing futuristic glasses that function as a rear-view mirror]

Marty: What the hell was that?

Doc: Taxicab.

Marty: What do you mean a "taxicab"? I thought we were flying.

Doc: Precisely.

Marty: All right, Doc. What's goin’ on, huh? Where are we? When are we?

Doc: We're descending toward Hill Valley, California, at 4:29 p.m. on Wednesday, October 21, 2015.

Marty: 2015? You mean we're in the future.

Jennifer: Future? Marty, what do you mean? How can we be in the future?

Marty: Jennifer... I don't know how to tell you this, but you're in a time machine.

Jennifer: And this is the year 2015?

Doc: October 21, 2015.

Jennifer: God, so, like, you weren't kidding.

Marty, we can actually see our future.

Jennifer: Doc, now, you said we were married, right?

Doc: [apprehensively] Uh...

Jennifer: Yeah? Was it a big wedding? Marty, we're gonna be able to see our wedding. Wow. I'm gonna be able to see my wedding dress. Wow. God, I wonder where we live. I bet it's a big house with lots of kids. How many kids...

[Doc uses a sleep induction device to knock Jennifer out]

Marty: Doc! What the hell are you doin’?

Doc: Relax, Marty. It's just a sleep-inducing alpha rhythm generator. She was asking too many questions, and no one should know too much about their future. This way when she wakes up, she'll think it was all a dream.

Marty: Then what did you bring her for?

Doc: I had to do something. She saw the time machine. I couldn't just leave her there with that information. Don't worry. She's not essential to my plan.

Marty: Well, you're the doc, Doc.

Doc: Here's our exit. [they get off and land in an alley; it’s raining] First, you've gotta get out and change clothes.

Marty: Right now? It's pouring rain.

Doc: [consults his watch] Wait five more seconds. [rain stops] Right on the tick. Amazing. Absolutely amazing. Too bad the post office isn't as efficient as the weather service.

[pulls off a mask] Excuse the disguise, Marty, but I was afraid you wouldn't recognize me. I went to a rejuvenation clinic and got an all-natural overhaul. They took out some wrinkles, did a hair repair, changed the blood, added a good 30 or 40 years to my life. They also replaced my spleen and colon. What do you think?

Marty: You look great, Doc. The future. Unbelievable. I gotta check this out, Doc.

Doc: All in good time, Marty. We're on a tight schedule here.

Marty: Tell me about my future. I mean, I know I make it big. But what? Do I become, like, a rich rock star?

Doc: Please, Marty, no one should know too much about their own destiny.

Marty: Right. Right. I am rich, though, right?

Doc: [hands Marty a capsule with shoes, a jacket and a hat] Marty, please, take off your shirt. Put on the jacket and the shoes. Got a mission to accomplish.

[looks through his viewfinder and spots Marty Jr.] Ah-ha. Precisely on schedule.

[Marty puts on the shoes and the laces automatically fasten] Power laces. All right.

[Marty puts on the jacket, but it’s too big] This thing doesn't fit.

[Doc presses a button on the sleeve]

Jacket: Size-adjusting fit.

Doc: Pull out your pants pockets. All kids in the future wear their pants inside out. Put on this cap. Perfect. You're the spitting image of your future son.

Marty: What?

Doc: Help me move Jennifer over here.

[Marty and Doc move Jennifer on top of pallets of shrink-wrapped discs]

Marty: So what's the deal?

Doc: Grab her feet. All right.

Marty: Okay, now what?

Doc: In exactly two minutes, you go around the corner into the Cafe '80s.

Marty: Cafe '80s?

Doc: It's one of those nostalgia places, but not done very well. Go in and order a Pepsi. [gives Marty some money] Here's a 50. Then wait for a guy named Griff.

Marty: Right. Griff. Right.

Doc: Griff's gonna ask you about tonight. Are you in or out? Tell him you are out.

Whatever he says, whatever happens, say no, you're not interested.

Marty: Okay.

Doc: Then leave, come back here and wait for me. Don't talk to anyone, don't touch anything, don't do anything, don't interact with anyone and try not to look at anything.

Marty: I don't get it. I thought you said this had something to do with my kids.

Doc: Look what happens to your son.

[shows Marty a copy of USA Today]

Marty: My son? God, he looks just like me.

[reading] "Within two hours of his arrest, Martin McFly Jr. "was tried, convicted and sentenced "to 15 years in the state penitentiary." Within two hours?

Doc: The justice system works swiftly in the future now that they've abolished all lawyers.

Marty: Oh, this is heavy.

Doc: It gets worse. Next week, your daughter attempts to break him out of jail, and she gets set up for 20 years!

Marty: My daughter. Wait a minute. I have a daughter?

Doc: You see? This one event starts a chain reaction that completely destroys your entire family.

Marty: Hey, Doc, this date... This is tomorrow's newspaper.

Doc: Precisely, I already went further ahead into time to see what else happens. I backtracked everything to this one event. That's why we're here today, to prevent this incident from ever happening. [his watch beeps] ****! I'm late!

Marty: Wait a minute. Where you goin’ now?

Doc: To intercept the real Marty Jr. You're taking his place. Around the corner at the Cafe '80s. Guy named Griff. Just...say...no!

Marty: Hey, what about Jennifer? We're not just gonna leave her here.

Doc: Don't worry, she'll be safe. It'll just be for a few minutes. And, Marty, be careful around that Griff character. He's got a few short circuits in his bionic implants.

Marty: The future.

Texaco Robot: Welcome to Texaco.

You can trust your car to the system with the star. Checking oil. Checking landing gear.

[a holographic ad for Jaws 19 from the movie theater across the street starts; Marty is scared as the shark looks like it’s gonna eat him]

The shark still looks fake.

[commercial for Goldie Wilson the 3rd's business appears on a screen in the sky]

Goldie Wilson the 3rd: Hi, friends. Goldie Wilson the 3rd for Wilson Hover Conversion Systems. You know, when my grandpa was mayor of Hill Valley, he had to worry about traffic problems. But now, you don't have to worry about traffic. I'll hover-convert your old road car into a skyway flier for only $39,999.95. So come on down and see me, Goldie Wilson the 3rd, at any one of our 29 convenient locations. Remember, keep 'em flying.

[Marty walks into the cafe]

Michael Jackson Waiter: It's got a hot salsa, avocados, cilantro mixed with your choice of beans, chicken, be-be-beef or pork.

Patron: Waiter. Waiter.

Ronald Reagan Waiter: Welcome to the Cafe '80s, where it's always morning in America, even in the afternoo-noo-noon. Our special today is mesquite-grilled sushi.

Ayatollah Khomeini Waiter/Ronald Reagan Waiter:

You must have the hostage special! Cajun style. You must have the hostage special!

Marty: [interrupting] Hey, hey, hey, guys Hey, hey, guys! All I want is a Pepsi.

[a bottle of Pepsi pops up from the counter]

Biff: [sitting in a booth] Hey, McFly! Yeah. I've seen ya around. You're Marty McFly's kid, aren't you?

Marty: Biff?

Biff: You're Marty Jr.

Tough break, kid. Must be rough bein’ named after a complete butthead.

Marty: What's that supposed to mean?

Biff: [knocks on Marty’s head with his cane] Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Hey. Hey.

Think, McFly, think. Your old man? Mr. Loser.

Marty: Loser? What?

Biff: That's right. Loser with a capital "L."

Marty: Look, I happen to know George McFly is no longer a loser.

Biff: No, I'm not talkin’ about George McFly. I'm talkin’ about his kid. Your old man, Marty McFly Sr., the man who took his life and flushed it completely down the toilet.

Marty: I did?

[correcting himself]

I mean...

I mean, he did?

[Griff walks into the cafe]

Griff: Hey, Gramps! I told you two coats of wax on my car, not just one!

Biff: Hey, hey, I just put the second coat on last week.

Biff: Yeah? With your eyes closed?

Marty: Are you two related?

Biff: [knocks on Marty’s head again] Hello? Hello? Anybody home? What do you think, Griff just called me "Grandpa" for his health?

Marty: He's Griff?

Griff: Gramps! What the hell am I payin’ you for?

Biff: Hey, kid, say hello to your grandma for me.

Griff: Get out here, Gramps.

[pulls Biff outside]

Biff: Hey, take it easy!

Griff: And, McFly, don't go anywhere! You're next!

Video game kid 1: This is a video game.

I got it working.

Video game kid 2: My dad taught me about these.

Marty: It is Wild Gunman.

Video game kid 1: How do you play this thing?

Marty: I'll show ya, kid. I'm a crack shot at this.

[“Crack Shot” appears on the screen]

Video game boy 2: You mean you have to use your hands? That's like a baby's toy.

[they walk away]

Marty: Baby's toy?

[Marty Jr. walks into the cafe; Marty sees him and ducks out of sight]

Marty Jr.: Pepsi Perfect.

Marty: Damn!

Marty Jr.: Pepsi.

Griff: Hey, McFly! I thought I told you to stay in here!

Marty Jr.: Griff. Guys, how's it goin’?

Griff: McFly!

Marty Jr.: Yeah?

Griff: McFly!

Marty Jr: What?

Griff: Your shoe's unbelted. So, McFly, have you made a decision about tonight's opportunity?

Marty Jr.: Yeah, Griff. You know, I was thinkin' about it. I'm not sure, because I just think, ya know, it might be a little bit dangerous, so...

Spike: What's wrong, McFly? You got no scrote? [grabs Marty Jr.’s groin and lifts him in the air as he cries out in pain]

Marty: He's a complete wimp.

Griff: What's it gonna be, McFly? Are you in or out?

Marty Jr.: I just... I'm not sure that I should, ya know, because I think that I should discuss it with my father.

Griff: Your father?

Whitey, Data and Spike: Your father?

Griff: Wrong answer, McFly! You lose!

[Marty Jr. lands on the other side of the counter]

Marty Jr., [dazed] Okay, Griff, I'll do it. I'll do it, buddy. Whatever you say.

Marty: Stay down and shut up.

Griff: [to 2 people on stationary bikes] Keep pedaling, you two!

[Marty puts on Jr.’s hat and hops over the counter]

Griff: Now, let's hear the right answer.

[Marty shoves him]

Griff: Well! Since when did you become the physical type?

Marty: The answer's no, Griff.

Griff: No?

Marty: Yeah. What are you deaf and stupid? I said no!

Griff: What's wrong, McFly? Chicken?

Marty: What did you call me, Griff?

Griff: Chicken, McFly!

Marty: Nobody calls me... chicken.

Griff: All right, punk! [pulls out a bat and swings it at one of the virtual waiter monitors electrocuting himself]

Marty: Hey, look!

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey.

[stops a little girl on a Mattel hoverboard]

Marty: Stop! Little girl, little girl. Stop.

Hoverboard Girl: Hey.

Look, I need to borrow your… Hoverboard?

Data: Where is he?

[Marty gives the girl the handle] Here.

Whitey: There! He's on a Hoverboard.

Data: Get the boards!

Spike: Get McFly!

Whitey: Get him!

Data: Yeah!

Spike: Yeah, we got him!

[A Jeep lands and Marty hitches a ride on the back]

Biff: There's somethin’ very familiar about all this.

[Marty passes by the cafe as Griff takes a swing with the bat missing Marty damaging one of his taillights. He then hovers over a car and glides over the pond adjacent to the courthouse mall and is about 2 feet from the edge]

Data: Hey, McFly, you bojo!

Those boards don't work on water! Unless you've got power!

Griff: [to his gang as he gets on his hoverboard] Hook on! [Pulls out the bat and prepares to hit Marty] Batter up!

[Marty jumps in the water as Griff swings and misses; his board catches the edge of the rocks surrounding the small pond; him and the gang go flying through the glass of the courthouse mall]

Marty: Holy shit!

Biff: [shaking his head] Buttheads.

[Marty steps out of the water, presses a button on the jacket]

Jacket: Drying mode on. Jacket drying. Your jacket is now dry.

Marty: Hey, kid. Hey, little girl, thanks.

Hoverboard girl: Keep it. I got a Pit Bull now.

Come on. Let's go.

Old Terry: Save the clock tower! Hey, kid.

Throw in a hundred bucks, will ya, and help save the clock tower.

Marty: Sorry, no.

Old Terry: Come on, kid. That's an important historical landmark!

Marty: Look, some other time.

Old Terry: Lightning struck that thing 60 years ago.

Marty: Wait a minute.

[Holo-ad showing an alert is seen]

Cubs win World Series. Against Miami?

Old Terry: Yeah, it's somethin’, huh? Who woulda thought? Hundred to 1 shot! I wish I could go back to the beginning of the season, put some money on the Cubs.

Marty: I just meant that Miami... What did you just say?

Old Terry: I said I wish I could go back to the beginning of the season. Put some money on the Cubbies!

[Terry walks away]

Antique store saleswoman [showing Marty the sports almanac]: Now this has an interesting feature. It has a dust jacket.

Books used to have these to protect the covers. Of course, that was before they had dust-repellent paper. Ah. And if you're interested in dust, we have a quaint little piece from the 1980s called a DustBuster.

Marty: [looking at the Almanac] I can't lose.

Doc: Marty! Marty! Up here!

Marty: Hey, Doc, what's goin’ on?

Doc: Stand by. I'll park over there.

Marty: Yeah, all right.

Hey, right on time.

Biff: Flying DeLorean. I haven't seen one of those in 30 years.

Marty Jr.: Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

[A car honks at him] Hey, I'm walkin’ here, I'm walkin’ here!

Biff: What the hell?

Marty Jr.: [to the driver in a hover car who almost hits him] Don't drive trank. Low-res scuzzball!

Biff: [sees Marty and Jr.] Two of ‘em?

Doc: [about Einstein] I left him in a suspended animation kennel. Einstein never knew I was gone! Marty! What in the name of Sir Isaac H. Newton happened here?

Marty: Oh, yeah, Doc, listen, my kid showed up. All hell broke loose.

Doc: Your kid? Great Scott, the sleep inducer. I was afraid of this. Because I used it on Jennifer, there wasn't enough power left to knock your son out for a full hour. Damn!

Marty: [looking at the newspaper] Doc, Doc, Doc, look at this! It's changing.

Griff: I was framed! [he is seen being lead away in cuffs]

Doc: [looking through his viewfinder] Yes! Yes, of course! Because this Hoverboard incident has now occurred, Griff now goes to jail. Therefore, your son won't go with him tonight, and that robbery will never take place. Thus, history, future history, has now been altered, and this is the proof! Marty, we've succeeded, not exactly as I planned, but no matter. Let's go get Jennifer and go home!

Marty: Hi, Einey. Hi, buddy.

[the almanac falls out of the bag]

Doc: What's this?

Marty: It's a souvenir.

Doc: "50 years of sports statistics." Hardly recreational reading material, Marty.

Marty: Well, hey, Doc, what's the harm in bringin’ back a little info on the future?

Ya know, maybe we could place a couple bets.

Doc: Marty, I didn't invent the time machine for financial gain! The intent here is to gain a clearer perception of humanity. Where we've been, where we're going, the pitfalls and the possibilities, the perils and the promise.

Perhaps even an answer to that universal question, "Why?"

Marty: Hey, Doc, I'm all for that. What's wrong with makin’ a few bucks on the side?

Doc: I am going to put...this...in...the trash.

Great Scott!

[Marty and Doc observe Officers Reese and Foley using a device to ID Jennifer]

Officer Foley: McFly, Jennifer Jane Parker, 3793 Oakhurst Street, Hilldale, age 47.

Officer Reese: Forty-seven? That's a hell of a good face-lift.

Marty: What the hell are they doin’, Doc?

Doc: They used her thumbprint to assess her ID. Since her thumbprint never changes over the years, they simply assume she's the Jennifer of the future.

Marty: Well, we gotta stop ‘em.

Doc: What are we gonna say? That we're time travelers? They'd have us committed.

Officer Reese: She's clean. That means we take her home.

Officer Foley: Home? To Hilldale? It'll be dark by the time we get out there.

[Marty and Doc notice the cops taking an unconscious Jennifer away]

Doc: They're taking her home, to your future home! We'll arrive shortly thereafter, get her outta there, and go back to 1985.

Marty: You mean, I'm gonna see where I live? I'm gonna see myself as an old man?

Doc: No, no, no, Marty. That could result in a [gasps] Great Scott! Jennifer could conceivably encounter her future self! The consequences of that could be disastrous!

Marty: Doc, what do you mean?

Doc: I foresee two possibilities. 1: coming face to face with herself 30 years older would put her into shock and she'd simply pass out. Or 2: the encounter could create a time paradox, the result of which could cause a chain reaction that would unravel the very fabric of the spacetime continuum and destroy the entire universe! Granted, that's a worst-case scenario. The destruction might in fact be very localized, limited to merely our own galaxy.

Marty: Well, that's a relief.

Doc: Let's go. I sure hope we find Jennifer before she finds herself.

[about to throw out the almanac] The Skyway's jammed. It's gonna take us forever to get there. And this stays here. I didn't invent the time machine to win at gambling; I invented the time machine to travel through time. [Doc drops the almanac on top of a garbage can]

Marty: I know. I know. I know, Doc.

[Biff has been eavesdropping from a store near the can Doc put the bag with the almanac in it on] So, Doc Brown invented a time machine.

[Officers Reese and Foley arrive in Hilldale; it is now night]

Officer Reese: Hilldale.

Nothin’ but a breeding ground for tranks, lobos and zipheads.

Officer Foley: Yeah, they oughta tear this whole place down.

House computer: Welcome home, Jennifer.

Whoa!

You all right?

Yeah.

You got a little tranked, but I think you can walk.

Officer Foley: Ma'am, you should reprogram. It's dangerous to enter without lights on.

Jennifer: Lights on? [lights turn on]

Yes. Now, look.

Just take it easy and you'll be fine.

And be careful in the future.

Jennifer: The future?

Officer Foley: Have a nice day, Mrs. McFly.

Scene screen: Broadcasting beautiful views 24 hours a day, you're tuned to the Scenery Channel.

Jennifer: I'm in the future.

[looking at hers and Marty’s wedding picture] I get married in the Chapel O Love?

Marlene: Mom?

[appears at the top of the stairs] Mom, is that you?

Jennifer: I gotta get outta here!

Marlene: Mom!

Mom? Mom, is that you?

Grandma Lorraine!

Lorraine: Sweetheart!

Marlene: Hi!

Lorraine: Hi!

Marlene: What happened to Grandpa?

Oh, he threw his back out again.

George: How's Granddad's little pumpkin?

Marlene: How did you do that?

How did he do that?

George: Oh, out on the golf course.

Lorraine: Are your folks home yet?

I brought pizza for everyone.

Marlene: Oh, who's gonna eat all that?

George: Oh, I will.

Doc: Damn this traffic!

Jennifer, that is Old Jennifer,

usually gets home around now.

I hope we're not too late.

Marty: What is it? What's the matter, Doc?

Doc: For a moment, I thought I saw a taxi in my rear display.

I thought it was following us. Weird.

Lorraine: Looking at the scene screen] I can't believe this window's still broken.

Marlene: Well, when the scene screen repairman called Daddy a chicken, Daddy threw him out of the house. Now, we can't get anybody to fix it.

Lorraine: Oh, look how worn out this is.

Your father's biggest problem, Marlene, is that he loses all self-control when someone calls him chicken.

Lorraine: How many times have we heard it, George?

George: "Mom, I can't let them think I'm chicken." "Can't let them think I'm chicken." You're right. Well, you're right!

Lorraine: About 30 years ago, your father tried to prove he wasn't chicken, and he ended up in an automobile accident.

Marlene: Oh, you mean with the Rolls-Royce?

Jennifer: [hiding in the closet] Automobile accident.

Doc: All right, Einie, let's find Jennifer.

Marty: I don't believe it. I live in Hil8ldale? This is great! Way to go, McFly.

Doc: Marty, stay here.

Just change clothes.

If I need you, I'll holler.

Marty: Come on, Doc, I wanna check out my house.

Doc: We can't risk you running into your older self.

Come on, Einie, let's go.

Where's Jennifer?

Where's Jennifer?

Hilldale.

This is bitchin'.

One, seven, four point five zero.

That will be $174.50.

Biff: Here.

I'd be careful, old timer.

This is a rough neighborhood.

Where's my receipt?

Right here. Here it is.

Hello. Hello.

How about a tip?

That accident caused

a chain reaction

that sent Marty's life

straight down the tubes.

If not for that accident,

your father's life

would have turned out

very differently.

The man in the Rolls-Royce

wouldn't have pressed charges,

Marty wouldn't

have broken his hand,

and he wouldn't have

given up on his music,

and he wouldn't have spent all those

years feeling sorry for himself.

Hey, Mom, nice pants.

I think the real reason your

mother married him was because

she felt sorry for him.

"Mom"?

Such a sweet girl.

Art off. I think maybe she deserves...

Okay, I want channels 18, 24, 63,

109, 87 and the Weather Channel.

The Weather Channel,

bringing you

the world's weather

24 hours a day.

Weather conditions

remain the same...

All board-certified

implant surgeons...

With a minor warm front...

Welcome home, Marty.

Hey, hey, hey.

Dad's home.

That's right. He's home. Dad's home.

Lord of the manor.

Hello. Hello.

King of the castle.

Hello.

What the hell is this?

Lithium mode on.

Yeah. That's better.

Damned kids.

The best...

Hey, Son.

Watching a little TV

for a change?

Son of a...

Hey, pizza.

I'm hungry.

All right.

Just wait your turn.

Grandma,

when it's ready,

could you just

shove it in my mouth?

Don't you be a smartass.

Oh, great!

The Atrocity Channel.

Hydrate level 4, please.

Mmm.

Is it ready?

Here you go.

Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

Mom, you sure

can hydrate a pizza.

I'm sorry. I missed

that whole thing.

Well, I'm just worried about

Jennifer. Why isn't she home yet?

I'm not sure

where Jennifer is, Mom.

She should have

been home hours ago.

I'm having a hard time keeping

track of her these days.

Hey, fruit.

Fruit, please. Thank you.

She's in one of those

moods, I guess. I don't know.

Aren't you and Jennifer

getting along?

Oh, yeah.

Great, Mom.

We're more like a couple

of teenagers, you know.

Dad, telephone.

It's Needles.

Dad, it's for you.

All right. Well, I'll take

that in the den. Excuse me.

Retract.

Hello.

I'm in here, please.

Hey, the big M.

How's it hanging, McFly?

Hey, Needles.

Needles?

So, did you take look at that

little business proposal of mine?

I don't know, Needles.

What are

you afraid of?

If this thing works, it'll solve

all your financial problems.

And if it doesn't work,

Needles, I could get fired.

It's illegal. I mean, what if

the Jits is monitoring, huh?

The Jits will

never find out.

Oh, God.

Come on. Stick your card in

the slot, and I'll handle it.

Unless you want everyone in the

division to think you're chicken.

Nobody calls me chicken,

Needles.

Nobody!

All right.

Prove it.

All right.

All right, Needles.

Here's my card.

Scan it. I'm in.

Thanks, McFly. I'll see

you at the plant tomorrow.

Chicken.

McFly!

Fujitsu-san! Konnichiwa!

McFly, I was monitoring that

scan you just interfaced.

You are terminated!

Terminated. No!

No! It wasn't my fault,

sir. It was Needles.

Needles was

behind the whole thing.

And you cooperated.

No, I didn't. It was a sting

operation. It was illegal.

I was setting him up.

And you knew.

McFly, read my fax!

No! Please, no. I cannot

be fired. I'm fired.

Oh, this is heavy.

What am I going

to tell Jennifer?

Jennifer. Jennifer.

Oh, Doc, am I glad

to see you.

Go out the front door.

I'll meet you there.

But it doesn't open.

There's no doorknob.

Press your thumb

to the plate.

What plate?

Marty, what does

this fax mean?

Oh, Mom, it's a joke, an

office joke. Kind of a joke fax.

Marty, I heard you yelling.

Mom, Mom, Mom,

calm down.

I wasn't yelling. Needles and

I were just kind of joking.

Welcome home, Jennifer.

Marty,

have you lost your job?

Lost my job, Mom? Get out

of town. Look, you know...

[2015 Jennifer and 1985 Jennifer see each other; they gasp in unison]

1985 Jennifer: I'm old!

2015 Jennifer: I'm young!

[they faint]

Marty! Marty!

Marty, come quick!

Quick!

She encountered

her older self

and went into shock,

just as I predicted.

She'll be fine.

Let's get her back

to 1985,

and then I'm gonna destroy

the time machine.

Destroy it?

What about that

stuff about humanity,

where we're going

and why?

The risks are just too great,

as this incident proves.

And I was

behaving responsibly.

You can imagine

the danger

if the time machine were to

fall into the wrong hands.

My only regret is that

I'll never get a chance

to visit my favorite

historical era,

the Old West.

But time traveling

is just too dangerous.

Better that I devote

myself to studying

the other great mystery

of the universe,

women.

Marty, Einie, brace yourselves

for temporal displacement.

Did we make it?

Are we back?

We're back.

Let's put her

in the swing.

Then I'll take you home,

and you can come back

in your truck

and wake her.

When she awakens here in

her own house and it's dark,

you should be able to convince

her that it was all a dream.

Wait a minute.

We're just gonna

leave her here

on the porch?

The disorientation will help

convince her that it was all a dream.

How long do you think

she's gonna be out?

I'm not quite sure. She

received quite a shock.

Could be for

a few minutes.

Most probably,

a couple of hours.

You better bring smelling

salts back with you.

You're the doc, Doc.

All right. Come on.

Let's go, Einie.

Don't worry.

She'll be fine.

I don't remember bars

being on these windows.

If you need me, I'll be back at

my lab dismantling this thing.

Right.

What the hell?

Hey. Hey, wait.

Wait a minute.

What are

you doing in my room?

Help! Rape! Mom!

Okay. Okay.

Dad, help!

Freeze, sucker!

He jumped me! Hey, it's okay.

I don't want any trouble.

He came through

the window!

You got trouble now,

you piece of trash.

What are you doing in here

with my daughter?

Hey, listen, I'm just

in the wrong house.

You got that right,

you little son of a...

Hey, look,

I made a mistake.

Damn right you

made a mistake!

Kill him!

I'm gonna tear

your ass up!

That's right.

You keep running, sucker!

And you tell

that realty company

that I ain't selling!

You hear?

We ain't gonna

be terrorized!

This has gotta

be the wrong year.

1985?

It can't be.

Drop it.

So you're the son of a bitch

who's been stealing my newspapers.

Mr. Strickland.

Mr. Strickland. It's

me, sir. It's Marty.

Who?

It's Marty McFly.

Marty McFly.

Don't you know me, sir?

From school, sir.

I've never seen you

before in my life,

but you look to

me like a slacker.

Yeah, that's right. That's

right. I am a slacker.

Don't you remember? You

gave me detention last week.

Last week? The school

burned down six years ago.

Now, you got

exactly three seconds

to get off my porch

with your nuts intact.

One.

Please, Mr. Strickland,

I just want to know what

the hell's going on here.

Two.

Hey, Strickland!

Yeah!

Eat lead, slackers!

Watch where you're going,

crazy drunk pedestrian.

Red.

Ladies and gentlemen,

welcome to

the Biff Tannen Museum.

Dedicated to Hill Valley's

number one citizen

and America's

greatest living folk hero,

the one and only

Biff Tannen.

Of course, we've all heard

the legend, but who is the man?

Inside, you will learn

how Biff Tannen became

one of the richest

and most powerful men

in America.

Learn the amazing history

of the Tannen family,

starting with his great-grandfather,

Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen,

fastest gun in the West.

See Biff's

humble beginnings

and how a trip

to the racetrack

on his 21st birthday made

him a millionaire overnight.

Share in the excitement

of a fabulous winning streak

that earned him the nickname

"The Luckiest Man on Earth."

Learn how Biff parlayed

that lucky winning streak

into the vast empire

called Biffco.

Discover how in 1979, Biff successfully

lobbied to legalize gambling

and turned Hill Valley's

dilapidated courthouse

into a beautiful

casino hotel.

I just want to say one

thing. God bless America!

Meet the women

who shared in his passion

as he searched

for true love,

and relive

Biff's happiest moment

as, in 1973, he realized

his life-long romantic dream

by marrying his high school

sweetheart, Lorraine Baines McFly.

How's it feel,

Mr. Tannen?

Third time's

the charm.

No! No!

Hey, you're coming

with us upstairs.

Let me go.

Look, sonny, we can do this

the easy way or the hard way.

The easy way.

Mom? Mom, is that you?

Just relax, Marty.

You've been asleep

for almost two hours.

I had a horrible nightmare.

It was terrible.

Well, you're safe

and sound now,

back on the good

old 27th floor.

Twenty-seventh floor!

Mom?

Mom, that can't be you.

Well, yes, it's me,

Marty. Are you all right?

I'm fine. I'm fine. It's just

that you're so... You're so

big.

Oh. Everything's gonna be

fine, Marty. Are you hungry?

I can call room service.

Room service?

Lorraine!

Oh, my God.

It's your father.

My father?

You're supposed to be in Switzerland,

you little son of a bitch!

My father!

Did you get kicked out

of another boarding school?

Damn it, Lorraine. Do you know

how much perfectly good dough

I've blown on this

no-good kid of yours, huh?

On all three of them?

What the hell do you

care? We can afford it.

The least we can do

with all that money

is provide a better life

for our children.

Hold on one second.

Let's get this straight.

Marty is your kid, not mine.

And all the money

in the world

wouldn't do jack shit

for that lazy bum.

Stop it, Biff.

Just stop it.

Look at him. He's a butthead,

just like his old man was.

Don't you dare speak

that way about George.

You're not even

half the man he was.

You son of a bitch!

Hey.

Always

the little hothead, huh?

You wanna

take a poke at me?

Damn it, Biff.

That's it. I'm leaving.

So go ahead. But think

about this, Lorraine!

Who's gonna pay for

all your clothes, huh?

And your jewelry

and your liquor?

Who's gonna pay for your

cosmetic surgery, Lorraine?

You were the one who wanted

me to get these things.

If you want them back,

you can have them.

Look, Lorraine.

You walk out that door,

and I won't only cut off

you. I'll cut off your kids.

You wouldn't.

Wouldn't I?

First your daughter,

Linda.

I'll cancel all

her credit cards.

She can settle her debts

with the bank all by herself.

Your idiot son, Dave. I'll

get his probation revoked.

And as for Marty.

Well, maybe you'd like to have

all three of your kids behind bars,

just like

your brother Joey.

One big, happy,

jailbird family.

All right, Biff.

You win. I'll stay.

As for you, I'll be back up here

in an hour, so you better not be.

He was right,

and I was wrong.

Mom!

Mom,

what are you saying?

You're actually

defending him.

I had it coming.

He's my husband,

and he takes care

of all of us,

and he deserves

our respect.

Respect?

Your husband! How could

he be your husband?

How could you

leave Dad for him?

Leave Dad?

Marty, are you

feeling all right?

No. No, I'm not

feeling all right!

I don't understand one damn

thing that's going on around here,

and why nobody can give me

a simple, straight answer.

Oh, they must have hit you

over the head hard this time.

Mom, I just want

to know one thing.

Where's my father?

Where's George McFly?

Marty, George,

your father

is in the same place he's

been for the past 12 years.

Oak Park Cemetery.

No.

No! This can't

be happening!

"March 15, 1973."

No! Please, God, no!

No, please, God.

Please, God, no.

This can't be happening.

This can't be...

I'm afraid it is

happening, Marty. All of it.

Doc!

When I learned

about your father,

I figured

you'd come here.

Then you know

what happened to him?

Do you know what

happened March 15, 1973?

Yes, Marty. I know.

I went

to the public library

to try to make sense

out of all the madness.

The place was

boarded up, shut down,

so I broke in and

borrowed some newspapers.

I don't get it, Doc.

I mean, how can all

this be happening?

It's like we're in

hell or something.

No, it's Hill Valley. Although, I

can't imagine hell being much worse.

Oh, Einie.

I'm sorry, boy.

The lab is an awful,

awful, awful, awful mess.

Attaboy.

Obviously, the time

continuum has been disrupted,

creating this new

temporal event sequence

resulting in this

alternate reality.

English, Doc.

Here, here, here.

Let me illustrate.

Imagine that this line

represents time.

Here's the present, 1985,

the future and the past.

Prior to this point in

time, somewhere in the past,

the timeline skewed

into this tangent

creating

an alternate 1985.

Alternate to you,

me and Einstein,

but reality for

everyone else.

Recognize this?

It's the bag

the sports book came in.

I know, because the

receipt was still inside.

I found them in the time

machine along with this.

It's the top

of Biff's cane.

I mean,

Old Biff from the future.

Correct. It was

in the time machine

because Biff was in the time

machine with the sports almanac.

Holy shit.

You see, while we were in the future,

Biff got

the sports book,

stole the time machine,

went back in time,

and gave the book to himself

at some point in the past.

Look. It says right here

that Biff made

his first million

betting on a horse race

in 1958.

He wasn't just lucky.

He knew because he had all the

race results in the sports almanac.

That's how he made

his entire fortune.

Look at his pocket

with a magnifying glass.

The almanac.

Son of a bitch

stole my idea.

He must have been

listening when I...

It's my fault. The

whole thing is my fault.

If I hadn't bought

that damn book,

none of this would

have ever happened.

Well, it's all

in the past.

You mean the future?

Whatever.

It demonstrates precisely

how time travel

can be misused

and why the time machine

must be destroyed

after we straighten

all of this out.

Right. :Marty: So we go back to the future, and we stop Biff from stealing the time machine.

Doc: We can't, because if we travel into the future from this point in time, it will be the future of this reality [indicates the alternate reality on a blackboard, 1985A], in which Biff is corrupt, powerful, and married to your mother, and in which this has happened to me! [holds up a newspaper; the headline reads: "EMMETT BROWN COMMITTED"] No. Our only chance to repair the present is in the past, at the point where the timeline skewed into this tangent. In order to put the universe back as we remember it and get back to our reality, we have to find out the exact date and specific circumstances of how, when, and where young Biff got his hands on that sports almanac.

Marty: I'll ask him.

[Biff is watching A Fistful of Dollars in the hot tub]

Bulletproof vest! Great flick! Great friggin’ flick! The guy is brilliant.

Hey, what the hell's going...

Hey! What the hell

are you doing in here?

Party's over, Biff.

Sorry, ladies.

How did you get past

my security downstairs?

There's a little matter

we need to talk about.

Yeah. Money, right?

Well, forget it.

No. Not money.

Gray's Sports Almanac.

You heard him, girls.

Party's over.

Start talking, kid. What

else you know about that book?

First, you tell me

how you got it.

How, where and when.

All right.

Take a seat.

Sit down!

November 12, 1955.

That was when.

November 12, 1955. That

was the date I went back...

That was the date of the famous

Hill Valley lightning storm.

You know your history.

Very good.

I'll never forget

that Saturday.

I'd just picked

my car up from the shop,

'cause I'd rolled it in a

drag race a few days earlier.

I thought you crashed

into a manure truck.

How do you know

about that?

My father told me

about it.

Your father?

Before he died.

Yeah. Right.

So there I was,

minding my own business.

This crazy old codger

with a cane shows up.

He says he's my

distant relative.

I don't see

any resemblance.

So he says, "How would

you like to be rich?"

So I said, "Sure."

So he lays

this book on me.

He says this book

will tell me the outcome

of every sporting event

till the end of the century.

All I have to do is bet on the

winner, and I'll never lose.

So I said,

"What's the catch?"

He says, "No catch.

Just keep it a secret."

After that,

he disappeared.

I never saw him again.

Oh, and he told me

one more thing.

He said, "Someday a

crazy, wild-eyed scientist,

"or a kid may show up

asking about that book.

"And if that

ever happens..."

Funny. I never

thought it would be you.

Yeah, well, Biff, you're

forgetting one thing.

What the hell is that?

You're dead,

you little son of a bitch!

Hey, there he is!

Hey, hey!

Oh, yeah!

Go ahead, kid. Jump.

A suicide will

be nice and neat.

What if I don't?

Lead poisoning.

What about

the police, Biff?

They're gonna match up

the bullet with that gun.

Kid, I own the police.

Besides,

they couldn't match up

the bullet that

killed your old man.

You son of a...

I suppose it's

poetic justice.

Two McFlys

with the same gun.

Idiot.

What the hell?

Nice shot, Doc!

You're not

gonna believe this.

We gotta

go back to 1955.

I don't believe it.

That's right, Doc.

November 12, 1955.

Unbelievable that Old Biff could've

chosen that particular date.

It could mean that

that point in time

inherently contains some

sort of cosmic significance,

almost as if it were

the temporal junction point

for the entire

space-time continuum.

On the other hand, it could

just be an amazing coincidence.

Damn!

Got to fix that thing.

All right.

Time circuits on.

What do you mean,

time circuits on?

Doc, we're not

going back now.

Yep.

Doc, what about Jennifer?

What about Einstein?

We can't just

leave them here.

Don't worry, Marty. Assuming

we succeed in our mission,

this alternate 1985 will be

changed back into the real 1985,

instantaneously transforming

around Jennifer and Einie.

Jennifer and Einie

will be fine,

and they will have absolutely

no memory of this horrible place.

Doc.

What if we don't succeed?

We must succeed.

This is heavy, Doc. I mean, it's

like I was just here yesterday.

You were here yesterday,

Marty. You were.

Amazing, isn't it?

All right, sunrise should

be in about 22 minutes.

You go into town. Track

down Young Biff and tail him.

Sometime today,

Old Biff will show up

to give Young Biff

the almanac.

Above all you, must not

interfere with that event.

We must let Old Biff believe he's

succeeded, so that he'll leave 1955

and bring the DeLorean

back to the future.

Right.

Once Old Biff is gone, grab the

almanac any way that you can.

Remember, both of our

futures depend on this.

You don't have to

remind me of that, Doc.

Here's some binoculars and a

walkie-talkie so we can keep in contact.

I'll stay here and try to repair

the short in the time circuit.

That way, we don't risk anyone

else stealing the time machine,

and I won't risk accidentally

running into my other self.

Other self?

Yes. There are now

two of me here,

and there are

two of you here.

The other me is the Dr.

Emmett Brown from 1955,

the younger me that helps the

other you get back to 1985.

Remember the lightning bolt

at the clock tower?

Yeah. That event doesn't

happen until tonight,

so you must be very careful

not to run into your other self.

Let me give you

some money.

I have to be prepared for

all monetary possibilities.

Get yourself

some '50s clothes.

Check, Doc.

Something inconspicuous.

Doc. Come in, Doc.

This is Marty. Over.

Roger, Marty. This is Doc.

Are you there?

Yeah, Doc.

I'm at the address.

It's the only Tannen

in the book,

but I don't think

this is Biff's house.

It looks like some

old lady lives here.

Biff!

Yeah.

Where are you

going, Biff?

I'm going to get

my car, Grandma.

When are you

coming back?

My feet hurt, and I want

you to rub my toes some more.

Shut up,

you old bag.

Give us

our ball back.

What ball?

That ball!

What ball are

you talking about?

Give us our ball!

What ball?

Biff!

Is this your ball?

Yeah!

Is it your ball?

You want it back?

Yeah.

Go get it.

Doc, it is Biff's house.

I'm on him. Over.

Hey.

Looking good, Terry.

Hey, Biff, she's all

fixed up just like new,

but I couldn't

get her started.

You got some kind of

kill switch on this thing?

No, you just gotta

have the right touch.

Nobody can start

this car but me.

Yeah, the bill

comes to $302.57.

300 bucks?

300 bucks for

a couple of dents?

No, hey,

that's bullshit, Terry.

No, Biff,

it was horse shit.

The whole car

was full of it.

We had to pay Old Man Jones

80 bucks to haul it away.

Old Man Jones

probably resold it, too.

Now I ought to get

something for that.

You want

something for it?

We'll go inside. You

can call Old Man Jones.

If he wants to

give you a refund...

It's 300 bucks, Terry.

If I catch the guy that caused

this, I'll break his neck.

The manure.

I remember that.

Four cans of Valvoline

is fair, Biff.

Four cans

for a $300 job?

I couldn't even

have lunch in the shop.

Makes me nauseous. I

should get a case of oil

out of you for a 300 buck

job. You've been inside.

It smells worse than the

bathroom at a gas station.

You robbed me again,

Terry. Yeah, yeah.

The smell's never

gonna go away, Biff.

Never gonna go away.

Last time I do you a favor.

Last time. Thanks a lot.

Let me see.

It's perfect,

Lorraine.

Oh, look at it!

You're going to

look so good!

You're going

to look...

Well, lookey

what we have here.

Hey, nice dress,

Lorraine.

Although, I think you'd look

better wearing nothing at all.

Biff, why don't you take a

long walk off a short pier?

Hey, listen, Lorraine.

There's that dance at

school tonight, right.

Now that

my car's all fixed,

I figure

I'd cut you a break

and give you

the honor of going

with the best-looking

guy in school.

Yeah, well, I'm busy.

Yeah, doing what?

Washing my hair.

That's about as funny as a

screen door on a battleship.

Screen door on

a submarine, you dork.

Look, Biff, somebody already

asked me to the dance.

Who? That bug

George McFly?

I'm going with

Calvin Klein, okay?

Calvin Klein?

No, it's not okay.

You're going

with me, understand?

Get your cooties

off me!

When are you gonna get it through

your thick skull, Lorraine?

You're my girl.

Biff Tannen,

I wouldn't be your girl

even if you had

a million dollars!

Yes, you will! It's

you and me, Lorraine.

Watch it!

It's meant to be.

I'm going to marry

you someday, Lorraine.

Someday you'll

be my wife!

You always did

have a way with women.

Get the hell out

of my car, old man.

You want to marry

that girl, Biff?

I can help

make it happen.

Oh, yeah? Who are you,

Miss Lonely-Hearts?

Just get in the car,

butthead.

Who are you calling

butthead, butthead?

How do you know

how to do that?

Nobody can start

this car but me.

Just get in the car, Tannen.

Today's your lucky day.

Hey! Hey! Hey, watch where

you're driving, old man.

If you dent this car,

I'll kill you.

This cost me

300 bucks!

Would you shut up

about the car?

Hey, and another thing. How

do you know where I live?

Let's just say

we're related, Biff.

And that being the case, I

got a little present for you.

Something that'll

make you rich.

You want to be rich,

don't you?

Oh, yeah. Sure. Right.

That's rich.

You're going

to make me rich?

You see this book? This

book tells the future.

Tells the results of

every major sports event

till the end

of the century.

Football, baseball,

horse races, boxing.

The information in here is worth

millions, and I'm giving it to you.

Well, that's very nice.

Thank you very much.

Now, why don't you make like

a tree and get out of here?

It's leave, you idiot.

Make like a tree and leave.

You sound like a damn fool

when you say it wrong.

All right, then, leave and

take your book with you.

Don't you get it? You could

make a fortune with this book.

Let me show you.

UCLA trails 17-16.

It's 4th and 11 with only

18 seconds left of this game.

I'd say it's

all over for UCLA.

Bet you a million bucks

UCLA wins it 19-17.

What are you,

deaf, old man?

He just said it was over.

You lost.

Oh, yeah?

Here comes Decker

with the kick.

It's up.

It looks good, folks!

It looks very good. Field

goal! UCLA wins 19-17.

Listen to that Coliseum

crowd go wild. Jim Decker...

All right, pops.

What's the gag?

How did you know what

the score was gonna be?

I told you.

It's in this book.

All you gotta do is bet on the

winner, and you'll never lose.

All right.

I'll take a look at it.

You damn fool!

Never, never leave

this book laying around.

Don't you have a safe?

No, you don't have a safe.

Get a safe.

Keep it locked up.

And until then, keep

it on you like this.

Hey, what are you doing?

And don't tell anybody about it, either.

And there's

one more thing.

One day, a kid or a

crazy, wild-eyed old man

who claims to

be a scientist

is going to come around

asking about this...

If that ever happens...

I'm trapped. Doc.

Doc, come in, Doc.

Marty, what's the report?

Biff's gone.

He's got the book.

The old man's gone, too.

I'm locked in Biff's garage.

You gotta fly

the DeLorean over here

and get me

the hell out of here.

The address is

1809 Mason Street.

I can't take the DeLorean

out in the daylight,

but don't worry, Marty.

Somehow I'll get over there.

Doc, wait a minute.

Doc. Hey, Doc. Doc.

Perfect.

Biff! Biff! Where are you going now?

I told you, Grandma.

I'm going to the dance.

When you coming home?

The dance.

I'll get home

when I get home.

Don't forget to turn

off the garage light.

Marty. Marty!

Marty.

Marty, Marty. Damn!

Where is that kid?

Doc. Doc, come in.

Come in, Doc.

Marty! Marty, come in.

Doc.

Marty.

Oh, my...

Great Scott.

Oh, my God.

Doc, Doc, come in.

Marty,

what happened to you?

I went to Biff's house,

and you weren't there.

You must have

just missed me.

I'm in the back

of Biff's car.

He's on his way to the

Enchantment Under the Sea dance.

Marty, listen, we may have

to abort this entire plan.

It's getting

much too dangerous.

Don't worry. The book

is on Biff's dashboard.

I'll grab it as soon

as we get to the school.

Marty, you must

be extremely careful

not to run into

your other self.

My other self?

Yes.

Remember, your mother is at that

exact same dance with you. Yeah.

Right. This could

get heavy, Doc.

Heavy, heavy.

Marty, whatever happens, you must

not let your other self see you!

The consequences

could be disastrous.

Excuse me, sir.

Yes, you with the hat.

Who, me?

Yes.

Be a pal and hand me a five-eighths

inch wrench out of that toolbox.

Five-eighths?

Don't you mean

three-quarters?

Why, you're right.

I presume you're conducting

some sort of weather experiment.

That's right.

How did you know that?

I happen to have had a little

experience in this area.

Yes, well, I'm hoping to

see some lightning tonight.

Although, the weatherman says

there's not gonna be any rain.

There's going to be

plenty of rain, all right.

Wind, thunder,

lightning.

It's gonna be one

hell of a storm.

Well, thanks.

Nice talking to you.

Maybe we'll bump into each other

some time again in the future.

Or in the past.

Doc, Doc! Come in!

Where's that punk

Calvin Klein, anyway?

How am I

supposed to know, Biff?

I ain't his secretary.

Well, go find him. He caused

300 bucks damage to my car,

and I owe him a knuckle

sandwich. Get going!

Drink up, Biff.

Yeah, thanks.

Ain't you coming?

I'm reading.

Well, well, well,

Mr. Tannen.

How nice

to see you here.

Why, Mr. Strickland,

it's nice to see you, sir.

Is that liquor

I smell, Tannen?

I wouldn't know.

I don't know what

liquor smells like,

'cause I'm too

young to drink it.

I see.

And what have we here?

Sports statistics, interesting

subject. Homework, Tannen?

No, it ain't homework,

'cause I ain't at home.

You've got a real

attitude problem.

You know that, Tannen?

Just watch it.

Because one day,

I'll have you

right where I want you

in detention.

Slacker!

Jesus,

you smoke, too?

Marty, you're beginning to

sound just like my mother.

Yeah, right.

When I have kids, I'm going to

let them do anything they want.

Anything at all.

Yeah, I'd like to

have that in writing.

Yeah, me, too.

Marty,

why are you so nervous?

Yes!

No!

"Oh Là Là?"

Doc! Doc!

Hey, you.

Doc, come in!

Marty, what's up?

Doc! I'm in trouble.

I blew it.

Where's the book?

Biff must still

have it with him.

All I got is

the damn cover.

And where's Biff?

You're asking for it.

I don't know.

Don't you have any

idea where he is?

No! I mean, he could

be anywhere by now.

Marty, the entire

future depends on you

finding Biff and

getting that book back!

I know.

I just don't know where...

Stop it!

Stop it, Biff. You'll

break his arm. Stop it!

Of course!

I gotta go.

I got one chance!

My old man is

about to deck Biff!

Yes!

Talk about déjà vu.

Are you okay?

Okay, everybody,

let's back up now.

Let's back up. Let's

everybody just back up

and give him a little bit of room, okay.

A little bit of air.

It's okay.

I know CPR. I know CPR.

Hey.

What's CPR?

You!

He's fine.

Hey, did you

just take his wallet?

He just took

that guy's wallet.

Doc, success.

I got it.

Thank goodness.

Great, Marty.

As soon as I reload

the fusion generator,

I'll meet you on the roof

of the high school gym.

On the roof. 10-4.

Hey, it's him!

Hey, he's in disguise.

Guys, what's that?

Come on!

Let's get him!

Damn!

Earth angel

Please be mine

My darling dear

Love you for all time

I'm just a fool

A fool in love

with you

All right!

Let's do another one.

Where did he go?

He just came in here!

Something

that really cooks.

Look! How did he

get up on stage?

I don't know, but when he gets

down, we're gonna nail him.

How the hell did he

change his clothes so fast?

All right, it's an

oldie where I come from.

All right, guys, listen,

this is a blues riff in B.

Watch me for the changes,

and try and keep up, okay?

Doc. Doc, come in!

Marty, come in.

Listen, Biff's guys chased me into

the gym, and they're going to jump me.

Then get out of there!

No, Doc, not me.

The other me.

The one that's up on stage

playing Johnny B. Goode.

Great Scott!

Your other self will miss

the lightning bolt

at the clock tower,

you won't get back to the future,

and we'll have a major paradox!

Wait, wait, wait.

A paradox?

You mean one of those things

that can destroy the universe?

Precisely. Marty, you have to

stop those guys at all costs,

but without being seen by your

other self or your parents.

10-4.

What the hell?

Where is he?

Who?

Calvin Klein.

Who?

The guy with the hat,

where is he?

Oh. He went that way.

I think he took your wallet.

I think he took his wallet.

Go, Johnny, go, go, go

Johnny B. Goode

Go, go

Go, Johnny, go, go

Go, Johnny, go, go, go

Go, Johnny, go, go

Go, Johnny, go, go, go

Johnny B. Goode

I guess you guys aren't

ready for that yet.

But your kids are

going to love it.

Hey, Doc, success.

Everything's cool.

Great. I'll be landing at the

school roof in about one minute.

I'll be there.

Lorraine.

Marty, that was

very interesting music.

I hope you don't mind,

but George asked if

he could take me home.

Great. Lorraine, I had

a feeling about you two.

I have a feeling, too.

Hey, butthead!

You think that stupid

disguise would get by me?

Let's have it out.

You and me, right now.

No, thanks.

What's the matter?

Where are you going?

Are you chicken?

That's it, isn't it?

Nothing but a little chicken.

Nobody

calls me chicken.

What the hell?

You steal my stuff?

And this one's

for my car!

Doc!

Doc! I blew it.

Biff nailed me.

He took the book.

He drove away

with it in his car.

It's my fault, Doc. I should

have got out of there sooner.

No time for that now.

Which way did he go?

East towards

the River Road Tunnel.

Get in!

Yes!

There he is, Doc!

Let's land on him.

We'll cripple his car.

Marty, he's in a '46 Ford.

We're a DeLorean.

He'd rip through us

like we were tin foil.

So what do we do?

I have a plan.

Repeating tonight's

earlier weather bulletin,

a severe thunderstorm is

heading for Hill Valley.

Serving Hill Valley

and all of Hill County,

you're tuned to KKHV,

the voice of Hill Valley.

Turning to

community calendar,

the Hill Valley

Women's Club bake sale

will be held

tomorrow afternoon

from 2:00 to 5:00 at the

community center on Forest Road.

For you sports fans

out there,

there was a lot of action

today in college football.

Here's what happened

to the top 10.

UCLA narrowly

defeated Washington 19-17.

Michigan State

crushed Minnesota 42-14.

Ohio State

beat Iowa 20-10.

Michigan

blanked Indiana 30-0.

Shit.

It was Notre Dame over

North Carolina, 27-7.

Son of a bitch.

Oklahoma ripped

Iowa State 52-0.

West Virginia lost

to Pittsburgh 26-7.

Texas A&M over Rice 20-10.

Maryland

defeated Clemson 25-12,

and it was Texas

Christian over Texas 47-20.

Repeating tonight's earlier

weather bulletin, a severe...

You again?

Give me that book.

Let it go!

Whoa!

Let go of the car!

That'll teach him.

Oh!

Go, Doc!

Hold on, Marty!

Shit!

Yes!

Manure!

I hate manure!

Doc, is everything

all right? Over.

10-4, Marty, but it's pretty

miserable flying weather.

Much too turbulent to make a

landing from this direction.

I'll have to circle around and

make a long approach from the south.

Have you got the book?

In my hand, Doc!

I got it in my hand!

Burn it!

Check!

Doc! Doc!

That newspaper changed.

Doc, my father's alive!

That means everything's

back to normal, right?

Mission accomplished.

That means Jennifer's okay

and Einie's okay, right?

That's right, Marty.

It's the ripple effect.

The future is back,

so let's go home.

Right. Let's get our

asses back to the...

Doc, Doc,

are you okay?

That was a close one, Marty.

I almost bought the farm.

Well, be careful. You don't

want to get struck by lightning.

Doc.

Doc?

Doc, come in, Doc.

Doc, do you read me?

Do you read me, Doc?

Come in. Doc.

Oh, no.

He's gone.

The doc's gone.

Mr. McFly!

Huh?

Is your name

Marty McFly?

Yeah.

I've got something for you.

A letter.

A letter for me?

That's impossible.

Who the hell are you?

Western Union.

Actually, a bunch of us at

the office were kind of hoping

maybe you could shed

some light on the subject.

See, we've had that envelope in our

possession for the past 70 years.

It was given to us with

the explicit instructions

that it be delivered to a

young man with your description

answering to the name of

Marty at this exact location

at this exact minute,

November 12, 1955.

We have a little bet

going as to whether

this Marty would

actually be here.

Looks like I lost.

Did you say 70 years?

Yeah, 70 years, 2 months,

12 days to be exact.

Here sign on line 6,

please.

Here you are.

It's from the doc!

[Western Union presents Marty with a letter from Doc]

Marty: [reads the letter] "Dear Marty, if my calculations are correct, you will receive this letter immediately after you saw the DeLorean struck by lightning. First, let me assure you that I am alive and well. I've been living happily these past eight months in the year 1885. The lightning bolt that…" [looks at the date] 1885! September 1885!

Delivery man: Whoa! Wait, kid! What's this all about?!

Marty: He's alive! The Doc's alive! He's in the Old West, but he's alive!

Delivery man: Kid, you all right?! You need any help?!

Marty: There's only one man who can help me!

Doc! Doc! Doc!

[after Marty has gone back to 1985, 1985A Marty suddenly shows up from down the street and runs to the unsuspecting 1955 Doc]

Marty: Doc, Doc! [grabs Doc, who shouts in shock] Okay. Okay! Relax, Doc! It's me! It's Marty!

Doc: No! It can't be! I just sent you back to the future.

Marty: I know. You did send me back to the future, but I'm back. I'm back from the future.

Doc: Great Scott! [faints]Doc! Doc. Doc.

Fantastic.
