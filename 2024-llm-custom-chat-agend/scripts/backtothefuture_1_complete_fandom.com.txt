INT. DOC BROWN'S GARAGE (1985) - DAY

CLOSE ON A TICKING CLOCK, showing 5 minutes to 8.

CAMERA MOVES, exploring, revealing MORE CLOCKS, of all varieties---cuckoo clocks, digital clocks, a grandfather clock, Felix the Cat with moving eyes...and all of them are ticking away in DEAD SYNC.

We continue exploring the garage, noting (in no particular order) a jet engine, a stack of unpaid bills addressed to "Dr. E. Brown” marked "OVERDUE,” automotive tools, electronics parts, discarded Burger King wrappers, a video camera, an unmade army cot.

We go past a CLOCK RADIO--it lights up and comes on.

Radio: October is inventory time. So right now, Statler Toyota is making the best deals of the year on all 1985 model Toyotas. You won't find a better car with a better price with better service anywhere in Hill Valley...

[Now we come to a COFFEE MAKER with a built-in clock timer. It too turns on---only there is no coffee pot!

Boiling coffee drips onto an already wet hot plate.

Another timer triggers a TV set-- an A.M. NEWSCAST is in progress, and the ANCHORWOMAN talks against a slide: "Plutonium Theft?” with the yellow and purple radiation symbol.]

Television: The Senate is expected to vote on this today. In other news, officials at The Pacific Nuclear Research Facility have denied the rumor that the case of missing plutonium was in fact stolen from their vault two weeks ago. A Libyan terrorist group had claimed responsibility for the alleged theft; however, the officials now infer the discrepancy to a simple clerical error. The FBI...

[We pass a TOASTER attached to a timer. Two pieces of black toast sit on it, and as the timer clicks on, the ashen toast drops into the toaster...again. Clearly, we are seeing a morning routine for someone who hasn't been home for awhile.

On the floor, a timer clicks on an electric can opener with an empty can of dog food. The empty can goes around.

Below it, in a dog dish labeled '’Einstein" is dog food that's been sitting for awhile.

Now we hear a key turning in the service door.

A pair of feet in Nike tennis shoes enters.]

Marty: Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's goin’ on? Wha- aw, God. Aw, Jesus.

[The boy drops his skateboard onto the floor and rolls it ... under the army cot, coming to rest against a yellow case with purple radioactivity symbols, stamped "PLUTONIUM. Property of Pacific Nuclear Research Facility."

SERIES OF SHOTS - CLOSE IMAGES

[Hands connect wires to terminals.

Fingers flip switches, illuminating "Power On" lights on consoles.

Hands twist rheostats.

Needles on gauges jump to life.

A hand poses in readiness over a set of GUITAR STRINGS, about to play...

Fingers turn a calibrated knob from "3" to "10."]

WIDER -- as we see a HIGH SCHOOL AGED KID (we can't see his face) ready to play his electric guitar. It's connected through a battery of amplifying equipment into a HUGE SPEAKER, 10 feet tall.

The kid hits it and there is a TREMENDOUS EXPLOSION from the speaker which literally blasts the kid off his feet and into a set of shelves which collapse, covering him with books, tools, and junk! The blown speaker smokes.

ON THE RUBBLE -- as the stunned kid regains his senses and looks around.

He’s MARTY McFLY, 17, dressed in jeans and a jean jacket.

Marty: Whoa.

[A piece of the speaker falls off.]

Marty: Rock and roll.

As Marty picks himself up, a huge ALARM BELL on the wall CLANGS. Marty runs over to the PHONE and answers it.

Marty: Yo.

Doc (on phone): Marty, is that you?

Marty: Hey, hey, Doc, where are you?

Doc (on phone): Thank God I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough; I'll need your assistance.

Marty: Wait a minute, wait a minute. 1:15 in the morning?

Doc (on phone): Yes.

Marty: What's goin' on? Where have you been all week?

Doc (on phone): Working.

Marty: Where's Einstein, is he with you?

Doc (on phone): Yeah, he's right here.

Marty: You know, Doc, you left your equipment on all week.

Doc (on phone): My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload.

Marty: Yeah, I'll keep that in mind.

Doc (on phone): Good, I'll see you tonight. Don't forget, now, 1:15 a.m., Twin Pines Mall.

Marty: Right.

[Suddenly all of the clocks strike 8:00 at once: chimes, cuckoos, and digital beeps all toll in a bizarre cacophony.]

Doc (on phone): Are those my clocks I hear?

Marty: Yeah, it's 8:00.

Doc (on phone): They're late. My experiment worked. They're all exactly twenty-five minutes slow.

Marty: Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Doc. Are you tellin’ me that it's 8:25?

Doc (on phone): Precisely.

Marty: Damn! I'm late for school!

[Marty hangs up. He puts his WALKMAN headphones on, grabs his backpack and reaches down to retrieve his SKATEBOARD. "The Power of Love" by Huey Lewis and the News plays.]

EXT. DOC'S GARAGE - DAY

The door opens, Marty throws his skateboard down and hops on. MAIN TITLES BEGIN.

Marty skateboards past the garage---an architectural gem that has seen far better days---and past a BURGER KING.

A TRUCK is pulling out---Marty grabs the back of it and hitches a tow down the street.

EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY

Marty is towed down another street, on his way toward Town Square and school. As the truck he's on continues forward, Marty lets go and turns down an intersecting street.

EXT. SERIES OF SHOTS - TOWN SQUARE - DAY

TITLES CONTINUE as Marty skateboards through a town square that has seen better days. We will particularly note:

The Essex Adult MOVIE THEATER, with a marquee that reads ”Wet Teenage Sluts," all seats $5.00.

The modern self-serve TEXACO STATION, where an old lady gets no help as she pumps her own gas.

Lou's Aerobic FITNESS CENTER, where 15 or 20 motley women are exercising in the window.

The BANK OF AMERICA, where customers wait in line at the VERSATELLER.

"ASK MR. FOSTER TRAVEL" advertising "10 days in Hawaii."

A dilapidated "Welcome to Hill Valley" SIGN on the corner.

The MAIN SQUARE in front of the old COURTHOUSE, a parking lot for the Department of Social Services.

And the abandoned TOWN THEATER, all boarded up, with "Assembly of Christ" on the marquee.

Marty hooks up on another vehicle and is towed along.

EXT. HILL VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL

The front of the school has chipped paint and graffiti on the walls.

MARTY arrives, hops off the skateboard, kicks it up and runs up the stairs. An ATTRACTIVE GIRL rushes out toward him. She's JENNIFER PARKER, 17, Marty's girlfriend.

Marty: Hello, Jennifer.

Jennifer: Marty, don't go this way. Strickland's looking for you. If you're caught, it'll be four tardies in a row.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

Jennifer peeks around the corner down the hall.

Jennifer: Alright, c'mon, I think we're safe.

Marty: Y'know this time it wasn't my fault. The Doc set all of his clocks twenty-five minutes slow.

Strickland: Doc?

They turn: it's MR. STRICKLAND, the stern, no-nonsense disciplinarian of a principal.

Strickland: Am I to understand you're still hanging around with Doctor Emmett Brown, McFly? A tardy slip for you, Miss Parker. And one for you, McFly. I believe that makes four in a row. Now let me give you a nickel's worth of advice, young man. This so called "Doctor" Brown is dangerous, he's a real nutcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble.

Marty: [sarcastically] Oh, yes sir.

[Clearly, Marty's looking forward to that kind of trouble.]

Strickland: You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of your father when he went here, he was a slacker too.

Marty: Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?

Strickland: I noticed your band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You haven't got a chance. You're too much like your old man. No McFly ever amounted to anything in the history of Hill Valley.

Marty: Yeah, well, history's gonna change.

INT. SCHOOL GYM - DAY

Audition Judge: Next, please.

[CLOSE on a sign reading "AUDITIONS - Battle of the Bands."

JENNIFER PARKER, 17, stands at the side of the stage and gestures with crossed fingers and a hopeful expression.

The object of her attention is MARTY, on stage with his band, "The Pinheads." Marty acknowledges her.

Then he steps forward to address the dance committee.]

Marty: Alright, we're the pinheads.

[They kick into a red-hot number (The Power of Love). Marty's fingers dance across the strings and frets in a complicated lead line.

He's terrific, and the band sounds great.

But they get only about 25 seconds into the song when the JUDGE, who ironically is the same person who wrote and performed The Power of Love, Huey Lewis calls out.]

Audition Judge: Okay, that's enough. Now stop the microphone. I'm sorry, fellas. I'm afraid you're just too darn loud. Next, please. Where's the next group, please?

[Marty and the group stop playing, exchanging bewildered glances.]

EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

Election Van: Re-elect Mayor Goldie Wilson. Progress is his middle name.

AN ELECTION SOUND VEHICLE wipes the screen, with red, white and blue bunting, proclaiming "RE-ELECT MAYOR 'GOLDIE' WILSON: HONESTY, DECENCY, INTEGRITY" and a picture of the incumbent. Mayor Wilson is black, about 50, with a GOLD FRONT TOOTH. The truck broadcasts a campaign speech by the mayor.

MARTY and JENNIFER are walking together. She carries her schoolbooks; he has the skateboard. And he's depressed.

Marty: "Too loud". I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody.

Jennifer: Marty, one rejection isn't the end of the world.

Marty: Nah, I just don't think I'm cut out for music.

Jennifer: But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of yours is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying.

Marty: Yeah. I know, I know. "If you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything."

[Marty eyes some exercise ladies, and Jennifer nonchalantly turns his head back to her.]

Jennifer: That's good advice, Marty.

Marty: Alright, okay, Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say, "Get outta here, kid, you got no future." I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. (sighs) Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old man.

Jennifer: C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night.

[Marty spots a tricked-out 4x4 truck on display in the town square parking lot.]

Marty: Check out that four by four. That is hot. Someday, Jennifer, someday. Wouldn't it be great to take that truck up to the lake? Throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back. Lie out under the stars. (sighs, admiring it longingly)

Jennifer: Stop it.

Marty: What?

Jennifer: Does your mom know about tomorrow night?

Marty: No, get outta town, my mom thinks I'm goin’ camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was goin’ up there with you. And I'd get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think the woman was born a nun.

[They pause across from the former courthouse building.]

Jennifer: She's just trying to keep you respectable.

Marty: Well, she's not doin’ a very good job.

Jennifer: Terrible...

[They’re about to kiss, when...

Woman: Save the clock tower!

[Marty and Jennifer turn. A middle-aged CHURCH GROUP TYPE WOMAN has a donation can and an armful of printed FLYERS.]

Clock Woman: Save the clock tower! Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. (points to the stopped clock on the old courthouse building) Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower, and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is, as part of our history and heritage.

Marty: Here you go, lady. There's a quarter.

[Marty drops a quarter into her can and turns toward Jennifer again---but before he can move closer, the Clock Woman sticks a flyer in front of his face.]

Clock Woman: Thank you, don't forget to take a flyer.

[Marty grabs the flyer out of her hand.]

Marty: [containing his annoyance] Right.

Clock Woman: Save the clock tower.

[She moves along to bother someone else.]

Marty: Where were we?

Jennifer: Right about here.

Mr. Parker: Jennifer!

[They move closer again as before, about to kiss...]

A CAR HORN HONKS LOUDLY. Jennifer turns away.

Jennifer: It's my dad.

Marty: Right.

Jennifer: I've gotta go.

Marty: I'll call you tonight.

Jennifer: I'll be at my grandma's. Here, let me give you the number.

She writes a phone number on the clock flyer handout and gives it to him.

Jennifer: Bye.

[The two finally kiss and Jennifer hops into the waiting car. "The Power of Love" kicks in again. Marty watches her go. Then, he looks at the paper Jennifer just gave him.]

INSERT - NOTE

[Along with the phone number, she's written "I love you!”.]

[Marty smiles, then looks at the back of it---a reprint of a newspaper article about the clock tower.

He folds it up and puts it in his pocket, and hops on 'his skateboard.]

EXT. LYON ESTATES - DUSK

A PICK-UP TRUCK cruises down the road with MARTY towed behind it on his skateboard.

As the truck passes an intersecting street, Marty lets go---that's where he's going. A pair of dilapidated looking lion statues indicate the entrance to a subdivision: "Lyon Estates." The lions are someone's failed idea of "class," and they're chipped, weathered, and covered with graffiti. Marty disappears behind them, and we HOLD a beat.

EXT. MCFLY HOME - DUSK

A WRECKER is in the McFly driveway with a 1979 Plymouth Reliant in tow: its front end is completely smashed, as if someone rammed it into a brick wall. The truck driver is unhitching it.

MARTY skateboards up to the scene and is shocked and disappointed.

Marty: [sarcastic] Perfect, just perfect.

[Marty walks into the house.]

INT. MCFLY LIVING ROOM

Marty enters and sees BIFF TANNEN, an intimidating lout of 48, lambasting Marty's father, GEORGE McFLY, a timid man of 47.

Biff: I can't believe you'd loan me your car without telling me it had a blind spot. I could've been killed!

George: Now, now, Biff, now, I never noticed that the car had any blind spot before when I would drive it. [Acknowledges Marty] Hi, son.

Biff: What are you blind, McFly? It's there. How else do you explain that wreck out there?

George: Now, Biff, um, can I assume that your insurance is gonna pay for the damage?

Biff: My insurance? It's your car, your insurance should pay for it. Hey, I wanna know who's gonna pay for THIS? (indicates his stained suit) I spilled beer all over it when that car smashed into me. Who's gonna pay my cleaning bill?!

George: Uh?

[George hesitates, then meekly pulls out his wallet.]

Biff: And where's my reports?

George: Uh, well, I haven't finished those up yet, but you know, I figured since they weren't due till-

Biff: [Tugs on George's tie and knocks on his head] Hello? Hello, anybody home? Think, McFly, think! I gotta have time to get ‘em re-typed. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my reports in your handwriting? I'll get fired. You wouldn't want that to happen would ya? WOULD YA?

George: Of course not, Biff. Now I wouldn't want that to happen. Now, uh, I'll finish those reports up tonight, and I'll run ‘em on over first thing tomorrow, alright?

Biff: Hey, not too early I sleep in on Saturday. Oh, McFly, your shoe's untied.

[He looks down and Biff hits him in the chin. Biff laughs loudly.]

Biff: Don't be so gullible, McFly. You got the place fixed up nice, McFly. [grabs a can from the fridge] I have your car towed all the way to your house, and all you've got for me is light beer?

[Biff heads toward the door and notices Marty staring at him.]

Biff: What are you lookin’ at, butthead? Say hi to your mom for me.

[Biff exits. Marty shakes his head and steps over to his father, outraged. He's about to say something, but George raises his hands and cuts him off.]

George: I know what you're gonna say, son, and you're right, you're right, But Biff just happens to be my supervisor, and I'm afraid I'm not very good at confrontations.

Marty: But the car, Dad, I mean he wrecked it, he totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean, do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue?

George: I know, and all I could say is I'm sorry.

INT. AT THE MCFLY DINNER TABLE - NIGHT

The McFly family is dining on meat loaf, Kraft macaroni and cheese, Bird’s Eye mixed vegetables, and French's instant mashed potatoes.

Marty's mother, LORRAINE, 47, was once very attractive.

Now she's OVERWEIGHT, in a rut, a victim of suburban stagnation. She has more food on her plate than anyone else, and a glass of vodka.

GEORGE has papers in front of him instead of food: he's doing the work Biff gave him. He's also glancing at the TV which is tuned to a "Honeymooners" rerun.

Sister LINDA, 19, is cute but wears too much eye makeup; brother DAVE, 29, wears a MCDONALD’S UNIFORM and is wolfing down his food.

George: Believe me, Marty, you're better off not having to worry about all the aggravation and headaches of playing at that dance.

Dave: He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches.

[Marty nods unenthusiastically. George and Dave both laugh at the TV.]

Lorraine: Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again.

[Lorraine tosses in a cake which says "Welcome Home Uncle Joey" with a black bird flying out of a barred prison window.]

Lorraine: I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line.

Marty: Uncle "Jailbird" Joey?

Dave: He's your brother, Mom.

Linda: Yeah, I think it's a major embarrassment having an uncle in prison.

Lorraine: We all make mistakes in life, children.

Dave: [checks watch] Goddamnit, I'm late.

[He wipes his mouth and hurries off.]

Lorraine: David, watch your mouth! You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here.

Dave: C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil.

[George can't help but chuckle at the metaphor.]

Linda: Hey Marty, I'm not your answering service. While you were outside pouting about the car, Jennifer Parker called you twice.

Lorraine: I don't like her, Marty. Any girl who calls a boy is just asking for trouble.

Linda: Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy.

Lorraine: I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age, I never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy.

Linda: Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody?

Lorraine: Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father.

Linda: That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car.

Lorraine: [wistfully] It was meant to be. Anyway, [grabs a cup and plate, heading to the kitchen sink] if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born.

Linda: Yeah, well, I still don't understand what Dad was doing in the middle of the street.

Lorraine: What was it, George, bird watching?

George: [absorbed in his work] What Lorraine, what?

Lorraine: [to Linda and Marty] Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him.

Linda: Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him, so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under the Sea Dance.

Lorraine: [thoughtfully, remembering] No, it was The Enchantment Under the Sea Dance. Our first date. I'll never forget, it was the night of that terrible thunderstorm, remember George?

[He's not listening, completely focused on the show.]

Your father kissed me for the very first time on that dance floor. It was then I realized I was going to spend the rest of my life with him.

[Again, George laughs at the show, Marty and Linda exchange a look.]

INT. MARTY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CLOCK ON MARTY'S NIGHTSTAND

It's almost 12:30. CAMERA PANS to pick up Marty lying asleep on the bed fully clothed. Marty's walls are covered with posters of rock stars and cars -—particularly Toyota 4x4's.

Now Marty's CORDLESS PHONE beeps. Marty stirs and answers it.

Marty: Hello.

Doc (on phone): Marty, you didn't fall asleep, did you?

Marty: Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly.

Doc (on phone): Listen, this is very important, I forgot my video camera, could you stop by my place and pick it up on your way to the mall?

Marty: Um, yeah, I'm on my way.

Marty hangs up.

EXT. TWIN PINES MALL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

CAMERA PANS from the lit entrance sign, depicting 2 PINE TREES IN A ROW with "TWIN PINES MALL” in lettering below (along with a digital clock at 1:16) to pick up MARTY on his skateboard with WALKMAN AND VIDEO CAMERA. Marty skateboards around a corner of the mall and sees...

AN OVERSIZED STEP-VAN with a drop-down tailgate (like a ramp) all by itself on the vast, sodium vapor lit parking lot. It's beat up, and has lettered on the side, "DR. E. BROWN ENTERPRISES - 24 HOUR SCIENTIFIC SERVICE.”

A large DOG sits patiently beside it. The animal has a battery-operated digital clock attached to its collar.

There are a few boxes, some equipment and a suitcase nearby.

MARTY skateboards over to the truck and the dog. It’s Doc’s dog, Einstein.

Marty: Einstein, hey Einstein, where's the Doc, boy, huh?

We hear an ENGINE REV UP--the truck engine?

The rear truck doors suddenly open with tons of steam and a SLEEK STAINLESS STEEL DELOREAN drives down the drop-down gate, onto the parking lot. It's been modified with coils and some wicked looking units on the rear engine.

Marty stares at it in amazement.

The DeLorean pulls up to him and stops. The gull wing driver's door opens and out steps DR. EMMETT BROWN, 65.

He's clad in a white radiation suit, hood off. His hair is white and wild, his eyes are full of life and energy.

Marty: Doc!

Doc: Marty, you made it!

Marty: Yeah.

Doc: Welcome to my latest experiment. This is the big one, the one I've been waiting for all my life.

[Marty ogles the vehicle.]

Marty: Um, well it's a DeLorean, right?

Doc: Bear with me, Marty, all of your questions will be answered. Roll tape, we'll proceed.

Marty: Doc, is that a DEVO suit?

Doc: Never mind that now, never mind that now.

Marty: Alright, I'm ready.

[Marty raises the camera. Doc clears his throat and addresses the camera.]

Doc: Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmett Brown. I'm standing in the parking lot of Twin Pines Mall. It's Saturday morning, October 26, 1985, 1:18 a.m. and this is temporal experiment number one. C'mon, Einey, hey hey boy, get in there, that a boy, in you go, get down, that's it.

[Einstein obediently jumps in and sits in the driver’s seat.

Doc buckles him in with the shoulder harness...]

Doc: Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch.

Doc holds up a digital watch next to Einstein's clock; indeed, the two are in dead sync.

Marty: Right. Check, Doc.

Doc: Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your head.

[Doc reaches in and starts the ignition. The DeLorean engine ROARS to life. Doc turns on the headlights and lowers the gull wing door, sealing Einstein in.

He steps back and picks up a REMOTE CONTROL UNIT, similar to one for a radio-controlled toy car. There are buttons labeled "Accelerator” and "Brake”, a joystick, and an L.E.D. digital readout labeled "Miles Per Hour".]

Marty: You have this thing hooked up to the car?

Doc: Watch this.

[Doc flicks the power switch on and, using the accelerator button and joystick for steering, sends the DeLorean down to the far, far end of the parking lot. Marty turns the camera to Doc at the controls.]

Doc: Not me! The car! the car!

[Marty turns back. The car is turned around from the other end of the lot. Doc pulls Marty along so that they're in the car's path.]

Doc: If my calculations are correct, when this baby hits eighty-eight miles per hour, you're gonna see some serious shit.

[Doc takes a deep breath, then pushes the accelerator button.

The DeLorean revs in place, shifting gears automatically.

The L.E.D. speedometer passes 30.

The stainless steel vehicle zooms faster...past 40...

Marty is getting it all on tape.

Doc watches intently. The speedometer climbs past 60.

IN THE CAR, Einstein remains calmly in the driver's seat.

Gauges and instrument lights mounted behind him begin flashing.

Holding the accelerator button down, Doc flicks the switch, and the car takes off.

The meter passes 75.

The DeLorean keeps accelerating, approaching Marty and Brown. The coils mounted around the car begin glowing.]

Doc: Watch this, watch this.

[The speedometer hits 85...86...87...88...

The automobile is suddenly engulfed by a BLINDING WHITE GLOW-- then, BLAM! It's gone, a TRAIL OF FIRE left in its wake.

Doc and Marty are hit by a sharp blast of air.

Marty blinks in disbelief: it's as if the car never existed.]

Doc: Ha! WHAT DID I TELL YOU?! 88 MILES PER HOUR!!!

[Only the LICENSE PLATE is left behind---a vanity plate: "OUTATIME."]

Doc: The temporal displacement occurred exactly 1:20 A.M. and zero seconds!

Marty: Ah, Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ, Doc, you disintegrated Einstein!

Doc: Calm down, Marty! [takes down notes] I didn't disintegrate anything! The molecular structure of both Einstein and the car are completely intact.

Marty: Then, where the hell are they?!

Doc: The appropriate question is, "When the hell are they?"! You see, Einstein has just become the world's first time-traveler! I sent him into the future. One minute into the future, to be exact. And at precisely 1:21 A.M. and zero seconds, we shall catch up with him and the time machine!

Marty: Wait a minute. Wait a minute Doc, uh, are you tellin’ me you built a time machine... out of a DeLorean?

Doc: The way I see it, if you're gonna build a time machine into a car, why not do it with some style? Besides, the stainless steel construction made the flux dispersal-- [his watch beeps as the DeLorean reappears almost hitting Doc and Marty] Look out!

Marty: What, what is it, hot?

Doc: It's cold, damn cold! Ha, ha, ha, Einstein, you little devil. Einstein's clock is exactly one minute behind mine, it's still ticking.

Marty: He's alright.

Doc: He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. [Doc demonstrates to Marty how the DeLorean operates] First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tells you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You input the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the Declaration of Independence or witness the birth of Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955.

Marty: What, I don't get what happened.

Doc: That was the day I invented time travel. I remember it vividly. I was standing on the edge of my toilet hanging a clock, the porcelain was wet, I slipped, hit my head on the edge of the sink. And when I came to, I had a revelation, a picture, a picture in my head, a picture of this. [Shows Marty a drawing of the Flux Capacitor] This is what makes time travel possible. The flux capacitor.

Marty: The flux capacitor.

Doc: It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day. My god, has it been that long? Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old Man Peabody owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees.

Marty: This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline?

Doc: Unfortunately, no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium.

Marty: Uh, plutonium, wait a minute, are you tellin’ me that this sucker's nuclear?

Doc: Hey, hey, keep rolling, keep rolling there. No, no, no, no, this sucker's electrical. But I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity.

Marty: Doc, you don't just walk into a store and ask for plutonium. Did you rip this off?

Doc: Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shoddy bomb casing full of used pinball machine parts.

Marty: Jesus.

Doc: Let's get you into a radiation suit, we must prepare to reload.

Doc: Safe now, everything's lead lined. Don't you lose those tapes now, we'll need a record. Wup, wup, I almost forgot my luggage. Who knows if they've got cotton underwear in the future. I'm allergic to all synthetics.

Marty: The future, it's where you're going?

Doc: That's right, twenty-five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five World Series.

Marty: Uh, Doc?

Doc: Huh?

Marty: Uh, look me up when you get there.

Doc: Indeed, I will. Roll ‘em. I, Doctor Emmett Brown, am about to embark on an historic journey. What have I been thinking of, I almost forgot to bring some extra plutonium. How did I ever expect to get back, one pallet, one trip. I must be out of my mind. What is it Einey? [The Libyans’ van comes into view] Oh my god, they found me, I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

Marty: Who, who?

Doc: Who do you think, the Libyans!

Marty: Holy shit!

Doc: I’ll draw their fire.

Marty: Doc, wait!

[But Doc keeps running ---and the van closes the distance. No way can Doc outrun it to the mall.

The Terrorist gunner screams a Libyan curse, then FIRES a burst at Doc.

The bullets rip into Doc’s chest and the scientist goes down.

Marty stands frozen in horror, video camera still in hand.]

Marty: [the Libyans have killed Doc] NOOOOOOO!!! BASTARDS!!!!

Libyan: [The gun jams] Go. Go.

Marty: [Marty hops into the DeLorean and peels off with the Libyans in pursuit] C'mon, move, damn it. Jeez. Holy shit. Let's see if you bastards can do 90!

Marty: [Marty is transported to 1955, and crashes into the Peabody's barn] Ahh. Ahh.

Ma Peabody: Pa, what is it? What is it, Pa?

Old Man Peabody: Looks like a airplane, without wings.

Martha Peabody: That ain't no airplane, look.

Ma & Pa Peabody: Ahh.

Old Man Peabody: Children.

Marty: Listen, whoa. Hello, uh, excuse me. Sorry about your barn.

Sherman: It's already mutated into human form, shoot it.

Old Man Peabody: [pulls out his shotgun and unloads a few rounds at the DeLorean as Marty drives away] Take that you mutated son-of-a-bitch. [As Marty drives off, he inadvertently hits one of the two pine trees on the property] My pine, why you! You space bastard, you killed my pine!

Marty: [Pulls a little way down the road and stops by the future Lyon Estates subdivision] Alright, alright, okay McFly, get a grip on yourself. It's all a dream. Just a very intense dream. [an elderly couple are driving down the road, which Marty stops] Whoa, hey, listen, you gotta help me.

Passenger: Don't stop, Wilbert, drive.

Marty: Can't be. This is nuts. Aw, c'mon.

Election Van: Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas...

Marty: this has gotta be a dream.

Lou: [Marty walks into Lou's Cafe, Lou is confused as to why Marty's wearing a puffer vest] Hey kid, what’d you do, jump ship?

Marty: What?

Lou: What's with the life preserver?

Marty: I just wanna use the phone.

Lou: Yeah, it's in the back.

Marty: [in the phone booth looking for Doc's address] Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, Brown, great, you're alive. Do you know where 1640 Riverside-

Lou: Are you gonna order somethin’, kid?

Marty: Yeah, gimme a Tab.

Lou: Tab? I can't give you a tab unless you order somethin’.

Marty: Right, gimme a Pepsi free.

Lou: You wanna a Pepsi, pal, you're gonna pay for it.

Marty: Well just gimme somethin’ without any sugar in it, okay?

Lou: Without any sugar.

[places a cup of coffee on the counter]

Biff: [to George who is sitting at the counter eating a bowl of cereal] Hey, McFly! What do you think you're doin’?

Marty: Biff.

Biff: Hey, I'm talkin’ to you, McFly, you Irish bug.

George: Oh, hey, Biff, hey, guys, how are you doin’?

Biff: Yeah, you got my homework finished, McFly?

George: Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday-

Biff: Hello? Hello? Anybody home? Think, McFly! Think! I gotta have time to recopy it. Do you realize what would happen if I hand in my homework in your handwriting? I'd get kicked outta school. You wouldn't want that to happen would ya, would ya?

George: Now, of course not, Biff, now, I wouldn't want that to happen.

Biff: Uh, no, no, no, no. [to Marty] What are you lookin’ at, butthead?

Skinhead: [notices Marty’s puffer vest] Hey Biff, check out this guy's life preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown.

Biff: Yeah, well, how about my homework, McFly?

George: Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning.

Biff: Hey, not too early. I sleep in Sundays. Hey, McFly, you're shoe's untied. Don't be so gullible, McFly.

George: Okay.

Biff: I don't wanna see you in here again.

George: Yeah, all right, bye-bye. [notices Marty staring at him] What?

Marty: You're George McFly.

George: Yeah, who are you?

Goldie: Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that for?

George: Well, they're bigger than me.

Goldie: Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you now, they'll be walkin’ all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?

Lou: [sternly] Watch it, Goldie.

Goldie: No sir, I'm gonna make somethin’ out of myself, I'm goin’ to night school and one day I'm gonna be somebody.

Marty: That's right, he's gonna be mayor.

Goldie: Yeah, I'm- mayor. Now that's a good idea. I could run for mayor.

Lou: A colored mayor, that'll be the day.

Goldie: You wait and see, Mr. Caruthers, I will be mayor and I'll be the most powerful mayor in the history of Hill Valley, and I'm gonna clean up this town.

Lou: Good, you can start by sweepin’ the floor.

Goldie: [Picks up George's bowl and walks away] Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that.

Marty: [Sees George riding away and chases after him] Hey Dad, George, hey, you on the bike.

Marty: [notices George up in a nearby tree looking through binoculars as Lorraine undresses] He's a Peeping Tom! [George falls out of the tree just as Grandpa Sam is coming down the street and Marty pushes George out of the way] Dad!

Sam: [Sam has just hit his future grandson Marty with the car. George looks at his future father-in-law and hightails it out of there] Hey wait, wait a minute, who are you? [George looks at his future father-in-law and then hightails it out of there.] Stella, another one of these damn kids jumped in front of my car. Come on out here, help me take him in the house.

Marty: [Marty is now laying in Lorraine's bed with Marty looking down at him] Mom, is that you?

Lorraine: There, there, now, just relax. You've been asleep for almost nine hours now.

Marty: I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible.

Lorraine: Well, safe and sound, now, in good old 1955.

Marty: 1955? You're my ma- you're my ma.

Lorraine: My name's Lorraine, Lorraine Baines.

Marty: Yeah, but you're uh, you're so, you're so thin.

Lorraine: Just relax now Calvin, you've got a big bruise on your head.

Marty: Ah, where're my pants?

Lorraine: Over there, on my hope chest. I've never seen purple underwear before, Calvin.

Marty: Calvin, why do you keep calling me Calvin?

Lorraine: Well, that's your name, isn't it? Calvin Klein. it's written all over your underwear. Oh,

I guess they call you Cal, huh?

Marty: Actually, people call me Marty.

Lorraine: Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here?

Marty: No, fine, no, good, fine, good.

Lorraine: That's a big bruise you have there.

Marty: Ah.

Stella: Lorraine, are you up there?

Lorraine: My god, it's my mother. Put your pants back on.

Stella: So, tell me, Marty, how long have you been in port?

Marty: Excuse me?

Stella: Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver.

Marty: Uh, Coast Guard.

Stella: Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank God.

Sam: What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age?

Stella: Don't pay any attention to him, he's in one of his moods. Sam, quit fiddling with that thing, come in here to dinner. Now let's see, you already know Lorraine, this is Milton, this is Sally, that's Toby, and over there in the playpen is little baby Joey.

Marty: So, you're my Uncle Joey. Better get used to these bars, kid.

Stella: Yes, Joey just loves being in his playpen. he cries whenever we take him out, so we just leave him in there all the time. Well Marty, I hope you like meatloaf.

Marty: Well, uh, listen, uh, I really-

Lorraine: Sit here, Marty.

Stella: Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner.

Sam: [pulling the TV closer to the table] Ho ho ho, look at it roll. Now we could watch Jackie Gleason while we eat.

Lorraine: Our first television set, Dad just picked it up today. Do you have a television?

Marty: Well yeah, you know we have two of them.

Milton: Wow, you must be rich!

Stella: Oh honey, he's teasing you, nobody has two television sets.

Marty: Hey, hey, I've seen this one, I've seen this one. This is a classic, this is where Ralph dresses up as the man from space.

Milton: What do you mean you've seen this, it's brand new.

Marty: Yeah well, I saw it on a rerun.

Milton: What's a rerun?

Marty: You'll find out.

Stella: You know Marty, you look so familiar, do I know your mother?

Marty: Yeah, I think maybe you do.

Stella: Oh, then I wanna give her a call, I don't want her to worry about you.

Marty: You can't, uh, that is, uh, nobody's home.

Stella: Oh.

Marty: Yet.

Stella: Oh.

Marty: Uh listen, do you know where Riverside Drive is?

Sam: It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple.

Marty: A block passed Maple, that's John F. Kennedy Drive.

Sam: Who the hell is John F. Kennedy?

Lorraine: Mother, with Marty's parents out of town, don't you think he oughta spend the night, after all, Dad almost killed him with the car.

Stella: That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility.

Marty: Well gee, I don't know.

Lorraine: And he could sleep in my room.

Marty: I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later.

Stella: He's a very strange young man.

Sam: he's an idiot, comes from upbringing, parents were probably idiots too. Lorraine, if you ever have a kid like that, I'll disown you.

Marty: Doc?

Doc: Don't say a word.

Marty: Doc.

[Doc is wearing a mind-reading device on his head]

Doc: I don't wanna know your name. I don't wanna know anything, anything about you.

Marty: Listen, Doc.

Doc: Quiet.

Marty: Doc, Doc, it's me, Marty.

Doc: Don't tell me anything.

Marty: Doc, you gotta help-

Doc: Quiet, quiet. I'm gonna read your thoughts. Let's see now, you've come from a great distance?

Marty: Yeah, exactly.

Doc: Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post?

Marty: No.

Doc: Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary?

Marty: Doc, I'm from the future. I came here in a time machine that you invented. Now, I need your help to get back to the year 1985.

Doc: My god, do you know what this means? It means that this damn thing doesn't work at all.

Marty: Doc, you gotta help me. you were the only one who knows how your time machine works.

Doc: Time machine, I haven't invented any time machine.

Marty: Okay, alright, I'll prove it to you. Look at my driver's license, expires 1987. Look at my birthday, for cryin’ out load, I haven't even been born yet. And look at this picture, my brother, my sister, and me. Look at the sweatshirt, Doc, Class of 1984.

Doc: Pretty mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother’s hair.

Marty: I'm tellin’ the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me.

Doc: So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985?

Marty: Ronald Reagan.

Doc: Ronald Reagan, the actor? [Scoffs] Then who's vice president, Jerry Lewis? I suppose Jane Wyman is the first lady!

Marty: Whoa, wait, Doc!

Doc: And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury!

Marty: Look, you gotta listen to me.

Doc: I’ve had enough practical jokes for one evening. Good night, future boy.

Marty: No wait, Doc, the bruise, the bruise on your head, I know how that happened, you told me the whole story. You were standing on your toilet, and you were hanging a clock, and you fell, and you hit your head on the sink, and that's when you came up with the idea for the flux capacitor, which makes time travel possible.

Marty: Something wrong with the starter, so I hid it.

Doc: After I fell off my toilet, I drew this.

Marty: Flux capacitor.

Doc: It works, ha ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works.

Marty: Bet your ass it works.

Doc: Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.

Marty: Okay Doc, this is it.

TV Doc: Never mind that, never mind that now, never mind that, never mind-

Doc: Why that's me, look at me, I'm an old man.

TV Doc: Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here in the parking lot of-

Doc: Thank God I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing?

Marty: Well, this is a radiation suit.

Doc: Radiation suit, of course, cause all of the fallout from the atomic wars. This is truly amazing, a portable television studio. No wonder your president has to be an actor, he's gotta look good on television.

Marty: Whoa, this is it, this is the part comin’ up, Doc.

TV Doc: No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity-

Doc: What did I just say?

TV Doc: No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need…

Doc: One point twenty-one gigawatts!! One point twenty-one gigawatts!! Great Scott!!

Marty: [running after him] What the hell is a gigawatt?!

Doc: How could I have been so careless? One point twenty-one gigawatts. [picks up a picture of Edison and puts it back on the fireplace mantle with the others] Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can’t!

Marty: Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium.

Doc: I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here.

Marty: Whoa, whoa Doc, stuck here, I can't be stuck here, I got a life in 1985. I got a girl.

Doc: Is she pretty?

Marty: Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope.

Doc: Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning.

Marty: What did you say?

Doc: A bolt of lightning, unfortunately, you never know when or where it's ever gonna strike.

Marty: We do now.

Doc: This is it. This is the answer. It says here that a bolt of lightning is gonna strike the clock tower precisely at 10:04 p.m. next Saturday night. If we could somehow harness this bolt of lightning, channel it into the flux capacitor, it just might work. Next Saturday night, we're sending you back to the future.

Marty: Okay, alright, Saturday is good, Saturday's good, I could spend a week in 1955. I could hang out; you could show me around.

Doc: Marty, that's completely out of the question, you must not leave this house. You must not see anybody or talk to anybody. Anything you do could have serious repercussions on future events. Do you understand?

Marty: Yeah, sure, okay.

Doc: Marty, you interacted with anybody else today, besides me?

Marty: Um, yeah well, I might have sort of ran into my parents.

Doc: Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother.

Marty: His head's gone, it's like it's been erased.

Doc: Erased from existence.

[Doc and Marty ware walking towards Hill Valley High. It looks brand new]

Marty: Whoa, they really cleaned this place up, looks brand new.

Doc: Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and they won’t have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next.

Marty: This sounds pretty heavy.

Doc: Weight has nothing to do with it.

Doc: Which one's your pop?

Marty: That's him.

[George is seen with a “Kick Me” sign on his back as other kids are kicking him]

George: Okay, okay you guys, oh ha ha ha very funny. Hey, you guys are being real mature.

Doc: Maybe you were adopted.

George: Okay, real mature, guys. Okay, Biff, will you pick up my books?

Strickland: McFly.

Marty: That's Strickland. Jesus, didn't that guy ever have hair?

[Strickland pulls the sign off of George's back]

Strickland: Shape up, man. You're a slacker. You wanna be a slacker for the rest of your life?

George: No.

Doc: What did your mother ever see in that kid?

Marty: I don't know, Doc, I guess she felt sorry for him cause her did hit him with the car, hit me with the car.

Doc: That's the Florence Nightingale effect. It happens in hospitals when nurses fall in love with their patients. Go to it, kid.

Marty: Hey George, buddy, hey, I've been lookin’ all over for you. You remember me, the guy who saved your life the other day?

George: Yeah.

Marty: Good, there's somebody I'd like you to meet. Lorraine.

Lorraine: Calvin.

Marty: I'd like you to meet my good friend George McFly.

George: Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you.

Lorraine: How's your head?

Marty: Well, uh, good, fine.

Lorraine: Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat?

Marty: Doc, she didn't even look at him.

Doc: This is more serious than I thought. Apparently, your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father.

Marty: Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you tellin’ me that my mother has got the hots for me?

Doc: Precisely.

Marty: Whoa, this is heavy.

Doc: There's that word again, heavy. Why are things so heavy in the future. Is there a problem with the Earth's gravitational pull?

Marty: What?

Doc: The only way we're gonna get those two to successfully meet is if they're alone together. So, you've got to get your father and mother to interact at some sort of social-

Marty: What, well you mean like a date?

Doc: Right.

Marty: What kind of date? I don't know, what do kids do in the fifties?

Doc: Well, they're your parents, you must know them. What are their common interests. What do they like to do together?

Marty: Nothing.

Doc: Look, there's a rhythmic ceremonial ritual coming up.

Marty: Of course, the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time.

Doc: Alright kid, you stick to your father like glue and make sure that he takes her to the dance.

Marty: George, buddy. remember that girl I introduced you to, Lorraine. What are you writing?

George: Uh, stories, science fiction stories, about visitors coming down to Earth from another planet.

Marty: Get out of town, I didn't know you did anything creative. Ah, let me read some.

George: Oh, no no no, I never uh, I never let anybody read my stories.

Marty: Why not?

George: Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand.

Marty: Uh no, not hard at all. So anyway, George, now Lorraine, she really likes you. She told me to tell you that she wants you to ask her to the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance.

George: Really.

Marty: Oh yeah, all you gotta do is go over there and ask her.

George: What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What is she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else.

Marty: Who?

George: Biff.

[Biff is playfully manhandling Lorraine, and she is getting frustrated]

Biff: C'mon, c'mon.

Lorraine: Leave me alone.

Biff: You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to ya.

Lorraine: Shut your filthy mouth, I'm not that kind of girl.

Biff: Well maybe you are, and you just don't know it yet.

Lorraine: Get your meat hooks off of me.

Marty: You heard her she said get your meat hooks, off, uh please.

Biff: So what's it to you, butthead. You know you've been lookin’ for a... [Strickland notices Biff grabbing onto Marty’s shirt collar and lets him go] since you're new here, I'm gonna cut you a break, today. So why don't you make like a tree, and get out of here.

Marty: George.

George: Why do you keep following me around?

Marty: Look, George, I'm tellin’ you George, if you do not ask Lorraine to that dance, I'm gonna regret it for the rest of my life.

George: But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater.

Marty: Yeah, but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break.

George: Look, I'm just not ready to ask Lorraine out to the dance, and not you, nor anybody else on this planet is gonna make me change my mind.

Marty: Science Fiction Theater.

[Marty, wearing the radiation suit Doc gave him in 1985, carefully puts the headphones from his Walkman on George's head. The Walkman has a tape inside of Eddie Van Halen guitar riffs recorded on it. He presses play which causes George to sit up in shock.]

George: Who are you?

Marty: Silence Earthling. my name is Darth Vader. I am an extra-terrestrial from the planet Vulcan.

[cut to the next day where Marty and George are walking by a gas station. Marty has a bottle of Pepsi which he has trouble opening; George uses the bottle opener on the dispenser]

George: Marty. Marty. Marty.

Marty: Hey, George, buddy, you weren't at school, what have you been doin’ all day?

George: I overslept; look, I need your help. I have to ask Lorraine out, but I don't know how to do it.

Marty: Alright, okay listen, keep your pants on, she's over in the cafe. God, how do you do this? What made you change your mind, George?

George: Last night, Darth Vader came down from planet Vulcan. And he told me that if I didn't take Lorraine, that he'd melt my brain.

Marty: Yeah, well uh, let’s keep this brain melting stuff to ourselves, okay?

George: Oh, yeah, yeah.

Marty: Alright, okay. Alright, there she is, George. Just go in there and invite her.

George: Okay, but I don't know what to say.

Marty: Just say anything, George, say whatever's natural, the first thing that comes to your mind.

George: Nothing's coming to my mind.

Marty: Jesus, George, it's a wonder I was ever born.

George: What, what?

Marty: Nothing, nothing, nothing, Look, tell her destiny has brought you together, tell her that she's the most beautiful you have ever seen. Girls like that stuff. What, what are you doing George?

George: I'm writing this down, this is good stuff.

Marty: Yeah okay.

George: Oh.

Marty: Let's go.

George: Oh.

Marty: Will you take care of that?

George: Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. [takes a sip]

[walks over to the table Lorraine’s sitting at with her girlfriends] Lorraine, my density has bought me to you.

Lorraine: What?

George: Oh, what I meant to say was-

Lorraine: Hey, don't I know you from somewhere?

George: Yes, yes, I'm George, George McFly, and I'm your density. I mean, I'm your destiny.

Lorraine: Oh.

Biff: Hey, McFly! I thought I told you never to come in here. Well, it's gonna cost you. How much money you got on you?

George: Well, how much you want, Biff?

Biff: Alright, punk, now-

Marty: Whoa, whoa, Biff, what's that?

Lorraine: That's Calvin Klein, oh my God, he's a dream.

Marty: Whoa, whoa! Kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop.

Kid: Hey!

Marty: I'll get it back to you, all right?

Kid: You broke it! Get back here! Wow, look at him go!

Biff: Let's get him.

Biff: To the car! To the car! Go, go!

Girl: What's that thing he's on?

Boy: It's a board with wheels.

Lorraine: He's an absolute dream.

Biff: Come on, come on, come on!

Marty: Ah! Whoa!

Biff: I'm gonna ram him.

Biff, Matches, 3-D, and Skinhead: Shit!

Marty: Thanks a lot, kid.

Biff: I'm gonna get that son-of-a-bitch.

Girlfriend #1: Where does he come from?

Girlfriend #2: Yeah, where does he live?

Lorraine: I don't know... but I'm gonna find out.

[Doc is watching the video from 1985]

Doc: My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

Marty: Doc.

Doc: Oh, hi, Marty. I didn't hear you come in. Fascinating device, this video unit.

Marty: Listen, Doc, you know there's something I haven't told you about the night we made that tape.

Doc: Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny.

Marty: You don't understand.

Doc: I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours.

Marty: You’re, you’re right.

Doc: Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model,

I didn't have time to build it to scale or to paint it.

Marty: It’s good.

Doc: Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts.

Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable accelerating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. [the car runs into a pail of oil-soaked rags sparking a fire.]

Marty: You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc.

Doc: Don't worry, I'll take care of the lightning, you take care of your pop. By the way, what happened today, did he ask her out?

Marty: Uh, I think so.

Doc: What did she say? [Lorraine appears at the door to the garage] It's your mom, she's tracked you down. Quick, let's cover the time machine.

Lorraine: Hi, Marty.

Marty: Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here?

Lorraine: I followed you.

Marty: Oh, uh, this is my Doc, Uncle, Brown.

Lorraine: Hi.

Marty: Hello.

Lorraine: Marty, this may seem a little forward, but I was wondering if you would ask me to the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance on Saturday?

Marty: Uh, you mean nobody's asked you?

Lorraine: No, not yet.

Marty: What about George?

Lorraine: George McFly? Oh, he's kinda cute and all, but, well, I think a man should be strong, so he could stand up for himself, and protect the woman he loves. Don't you?

Marty: Yeah.

[Marty is talking to George while he's hanging up clothes on the line outside]

George: I still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to the dance with you?

Marty: Cause, George, she wants to go to the dance with you, she just doesn't know it yet. That's why we gotta show her that you, George McFly, are a fighter. You're somebody who's gonna stand up for yourself, someone who's gonna protect her.

George: Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life.

Marty: You're not gonna be picking a fight, Dad, dad dad daddy-o. You're coming to her rescue, right? Okay, let's go over the plan again. 8:55, where are you gonna be?

George: I'm gonna be at the dance.

Marty: Right, and where am I gonna be?

George: You're gonna be in the car with her.

Marty: Right, okay, so right around 9:00 she's gonna get very angry with me.

George: Why is she gonna get angry with you?

Marty: Well, because George, nice girls get angry when guys take advantage of them.

George: Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her-

Marty: No, no, George, look, it's just an act, right? Okay, so 9:00…you're strolling through the parking lot, you see us struggling in the car, you walk up, you open the door and you say, your line, George.

George: Oh, uh, hey you, get your damn hands off her. Do you really think I oughta swear?

Marty: Yes, definitely, goddamnit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after.

George: Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared.

Marty: George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self-confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything.

Radio: This Saturday night, mostly clear, with some scattered clouds. Lows in the upper forties.

Doc: Are you sure about this storm?

Marty: When could weathermen predict the weather, let alone the future.

Doc: You know Marty, I'm gonna be very sad to see you go. You've really made a difference in my life; you've given me something to shoot for. Just knowing, that I'm gonna be around to see 1985, that I'm gonna succeed in this. That I'm gonna have a chance to travel through time. It's gonna be really hard waiting 30 years before I could talk to you about everything that's happened in the past few days. I'm really gonna miss you, Marty.

Marty: I'm really gonna miss you. Doc, about the future-

Doc: No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time.

[In Lou’s Diner writing a letter to Doc]

Marty: Dear Doctor Brown, on the night that I go back in time, you will be shot by terrorists. Please take whatever precautions are necessary to prevent this terrible disaster. Your friend, Marty.

Cop: Evening, Doctor Brown, what's with the wire?

Doc: Oh, just a little weather experiment.

Cop: What you got under here?

Doc: Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather-sensing equipment.

Cop: You got a permit for that?

Doc: Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it.

[Mary and Lorraine pull up to the school in Doc's convertible]

Marty: Do you mind if we park for a while?

Lorraine: That's a great idea. I'd love to park.

Marty: Huh?

Lorraine: Well, Marty, I'm almost eighteen-years-old, it's not like I've never parked before.

Marty: What?

Lorraine: Marty, you seem so nervous, is something wrong?

[Lorraine pulls out a bottle of liquor]

Marty: No no. Lorraine, Lorraine, what are you doing?

Lorraine: I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.

[takes a swig]

Marty: Yeah well, you shouldn't drink.

Lorraine: Why not?

Marty: Because, you might regret it later in life.

Lorraine: Marty, don't be such a square. Everybody who's anybody drinks.

Marty: [spit takes as she lights a cigarette]] Jesus, you smoke too?

Lorraine: Marty, you're beginning to sound just like my mother.

Marvin Berry: We're gonna take a little break but we'll be back in a while so, don't nobody go nowhere.

Lorraine: Marty, why are you so nervous?

Marty: Lorraine, have you ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with it?

Lorraine: Oh, you mean how you're supposed to act on a first date.

Marty: Ah well, sort of.

Lorraine: I think I know exactly what you mean.

Marty: You do?

Lorraine: You know what I do in those situations?

Marty: What?

Lorraine: I don't worry. [kisses him hard, then stops and pulls back to see Marty is shocked] this is all wrong. I don't know what it is but when I kiss you, it's like kissing my brother. I guess that doesn't make any sense, does it?

Marty: Well, you mean, it makes perfect sense.

Biff: You cost three-hundred buck damage to my car, you son-of-a-bitch. And I'm gonna take it out of your ass. Hold him.

Lorraine: Let him go, Biff, you're drunk.

Biff: Well, looky what we have here. No no no, you're stayin’ right here with me.

Lorraine: Stop it.

Biff: C'mon.

Lorraine: Stop it.

Biff: C'mon.

Marty: Leave her alone, you bastard.

Biff: You guys, take him in back and I'll be right there. Well, c'mon, this ain't no peep show.

Skinhead: Let's put him in there.

3-D: Yeah.

Skinhead: That's for messing up my hair.

Starlighter: The hell you doin’ to my car?

3-D: Hey beat it, spook, this don't concern you.

Marvin Berry: Who are you callin’ spook, peckerwood?

Skinhead: Hey, hey listen guys. Look, I don't wanna mess with no reefer addicts, okay?

Marty: C'mon, open up, let me out of here, Yo.

Marvin Berry: Lorenzo, where're your keys?

Marty: [in the trunk] The keys are in the trunk.

Marvin Berry: Say that again.

Marty: I said the keys are in here.

George: [opens the door to find...] Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh.

Biff: I think you got the wrong car, McFly.

Lorraine: [Biff is molesting her] George, help me, please.

Biff: Just turn around, McFly, and walk away. Are you deaf, McFly? Close the door and beat it.

George: No, Biff, you leave her alone.

Biff: Alright, McFly, you're askin’ for it, and now you're gonna get it.

Lorraine: Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop.

Marvin Berry: Give me a hand, Lorenzo. [slices his hand trying to pop the lock on the trunk] Ow, damnit, man, I sliced my hand.

Marty: Who's are these?

Starlighter: Thanks, thanks a lot.

Lorraine: You're gonna break his arm. Biff, leave him alone. Let him go. Let him go.

[knocks Biff out cold]

George: Are you okay?

Girlfriend: Who is that guy?

Boyfriend: That's George McFly.

Girlfriend: That's George McFly?

Marty: Excuse me.

Doc: The storm.

Marty: Hey guys, you gotta get back in there and finish the dance.

Starlighter: Hey man, look at Marvin's hand. He can't play with his hands like that, and we can't play without him.

Marty: Yeah, well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall in love and I'm history.

Marvin Berry: Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who can play the guitar.

Marvin Berry: This is for all you lovers out there.

["Earth Angel" plays]

Lorraine: George, aren't you gonna kiss me?

George: I, I don't know.

Dixon: Scram, McFly. [Dixon pushes George away and starts dancing with Lorraine]

Starlighter: Hey boy, are you alright?

Marty: I can't play.

[Marty starts to weaken and falls to the floor as he plays discordant cords on the guitar]

Lorraine: George. George.

Marty: George.

[Pushes Dixon to the floor]

George: Excuse me.

[Marty regains his energy and continues the song]

Marvin Berry: Yeah man, that was good. Let's do another one.

Marty: Uh, well, I gotta go.

Marvin Berry: C'mon man, let's do something that really cooks.

Marty: Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in B, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay?

Boyfriend: Hey George, heard you laid out Biff, nice going.

Girlfriend: George: you ever think of running for class president?

Marvin Berry: Chuck, Chuck, it’s your cousin. Your cousin Marvin. Marvin Berry! You know that new sound you're lookin’ for, well listen to this!

[Marty goes ham on the guitar which results in everyone covering their ears]

Marty: I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it.

Marty: Lorraine.

Lorraine: Marty, that was very interesting music.

Marty: Uh, yeah.

Lorraine: I hope you don't mind but George asked if he could take me home.

Marty: Great good, good, Lorraine, I had a feeling about you two.

Lorraine: I have a feeling too.

Marty: Listen, I gotta go but I wanted to tell you that it's been educational.

Lorraine: Marty, will we ever see you again?

Marty: I guarantee it.

George: Well, Marty, I wanna thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it.

Marty: Right, George. Well, good luck you guys. Oh, one other thing, if you guys ever have kids and one of them when he's eight years old, accidentally sets fire to the living room rug, go easy on him.

George: Okay.

Lorraine: Marty, such a nice name.

Doc: Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time?

Marty: Hey c'mon, I had to change, you think I'm goin' back in that… zoot suit? The old man really came through, it worked.

Doc: What?

Marty: He laid out Biff in one punch. I never knew he had it in him. He never stood up to Biff in his life.

Doc: Never?

Marty: No, why, what's a matter?

Doc: Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It'll be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas.

Marty: Right.

Doc: Well, I guess that's everything.

Marty: Thanks.

Doc: Thank you. In about thirty years.

Marty: I hope so.

Doc: Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine.

Marty: Right.

[Doc discovers the letter in his coat pocket]

Doc: What's the meaning of this?

Marty: You'll find out in thirty years.

Doc: It's about the future, isn't it?

Marty: Wait a minute.

Doc: It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous.

Marty: Now that's a risk you'll have to take your life depends on it.

Doc: No, I refuse to except the responsibility.

Marty: In that case, I'll tell you straight out.

Doc: Oh, Great Scott. You get the cable; I'll throw the rope down to you.

Marty: Right, I got it.

Doc: Ahh.

Marty: Doc.

Doc: C'mon, c'mon let's go.

Marty: Alright, take it up, go. Doc.

Doc: Huh?

Marty: I have to tell you about the future.

Doc: Huh?

Marty: I have to tell ya about the future.

Doc: Ahh.

Marty: On the night I go back in time, you get- Doc.

Doc: Ohh, no.

Marty: No, Doc.

Doc: Look at the time, you've got less than 4 minutes, please hurry.

Marty: Yeah.

Marty: Damn it, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him. 10 minutes oughta do it. Time-circuits on, flux-capacitor fluxing, engine running, alright. [DeLorean stalls] No, no no no no, c'mon c'mon. C'mon c'mon, here we go, this time. Please, please, c'mon. [bangs his head on the steering wheel. It roars to life]

Doc: Ahh.

Marty: Doc.

Doc: Yoo.

[Marty crashes into the Essex Theater]

Red: Crazy drunk driver.

Marty: Wow, ah Red, you look great. Everything looks great. 1:24, I still got time. [the DeLorean stalls again] Oh my god. No, no not again, c'mon, c'mon. Hey. Libyans.

Marty: No, bastards.

Libyan: Go.

Marty: Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. [Doc reveals the letter Marty wrote in 1955 which has been taped back together] What about all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum?

Doc: Well, I figured, what the hell.

Marty: About how far ahead are you going?

Doc: About 30 years, it's a nice round number.

Marty: Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47.

Doc: I will.

Marty: Take care.

Doc: You too.

Marty: Alright, good-bye Einey. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy.

Doc: You bet.

[Cut to next morning; Marty wakes up and walks into the kitchen to see a full table of breakfast with Linda and Dave sitting there. Dave is now wearing a suit.]

Marty: What a nightmare.

Lynda: Oh, if Paul calls me tell him I'm working at the boutique late tonight.

Dave: Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago.

Lynda: Now which one was it, Greg or Craig?

Dave: I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends.

Marty: What the hell is this?

Lynda: Breakfast.

Dave: What did you sleep in your clothes again last night?

Marty: Yeah, yeah what are you wearin’, Dave?

Dave: Marty, I always wear a suit to the office. You alright?

Marty: Yeah.

[George and Lorraine come in the house returning from a tennis match]

Lorraine: I think we need a rematch.

George: Oh, oh a rematch, why, were you cheating?

Lorraine: No.

George: Hello.

Lorraine: Good morning.

[Marty is shocked to see Lorraine skinny and attractive; he falls]

Marty: Mom, Dad.

Lorraine: Marty, are you alright?

Dave: Did you hurt your head?

Marty: You guys look great. Mom, you look so thin.

Lorraine: Why thank you, Marty. [George touches her playfully] George. Good morning, sleepyhead, good morning, Dave, Lynda.

Dave: Good morning, Mom.

Lynda: Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called.

Lorraine: Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date?

Marty: What, what, ma?

Lorraine: [takes a sip of coffee] Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks.

Marty: Well, ma, we talked about this, we're not gonna go to the lake, the car's wrecked.

George: Wrecked?

Dave: Wrecked? When did this happen and-

George: Quiet down, I'm sure the car is fine.

Dave: Why am I always the last one to know about these things?

George: See, there's Biff out there waxing it right now. Now, Biff, I wanna make sure that we get two coats of wax this time, not just one.

Biff: Just finishin’ up the second coat now.

George: Now Biff, don't con me.

Biff: I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat.

George: That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him-

Lorraine: We never would have fallen in love.

George: That's right.

[Biff walks in the house with a box]

Biff: Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book.

Lorraine: [opens the box] Ah, honey, your first novel.

George: Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything.

Biff: Oh, oh Marty, here's your keys. You're all waxed up, ready for tonight.

Marty: Keys?

[Marty opens up the garage to see the Toyota truck he was ogling at the beginning of the movie as Jennifer appears]

Jennifer: How about a ride, Mister?

Marty: Jennifer, oh are you a sight for sore eyes. Let me look at you.

Jennifer: Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week.

Marty: I haven't.

Jennifer: You okay, is everything alright?

Marty: Aw yeah, everything is great.

[Doc pulls up to the driveway and gets out of the DeLorean]

Doc: Marty, you gotta come back with me.

Marty: Where?

Doc: Back to the future!

Marty: Wait a minute, what are you doin’, Doc?

[Doc puts some garbage into Mr. Fusion]

Doc: I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car.

Marty: No no no, Doc, I just got here, okay, Jennifer's here, we're gonna take the new truck for a spin.

Doc: Well, bring her along. This concerns her too.

Marty: Wait a minute, Doc. What are you talkin’ about? What happens to us in the future?

What, do we become assholes or somethin’?

Doc: No no no no no, Marty, both you and Jennifer turn out fine. It's your kids, Marty, something has gotta be done about your kids.

Marty: Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough road to get up to 88.

Doc: Roads? Where we're going, we don't need roads.

THE END
