  - **Privacy**: control your personal data
  - **Choice**: mix and match devices
  - **Sustainability**: repurpose your hardware
- It's [worldwide adopted](https://analytics.home-assistant.io/) with 361k active installation as of today (_12k in Italy_)
- Has [11 years](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/09/17/10-years-home-assistant/) of development
- It's the 2nd most active open-source project in the world according to [GitHubâ€™s 2023 Octoverse report](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-state-of-open-source-and-ai/#the-state-of-open-source)
