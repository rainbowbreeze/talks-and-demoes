Back To The Future III

Saturday

November 12, 1955

10:03 PM

[Scene: The clock tower in 1955, changed because of Marty II's interference. DeLorean and Marty 1 speeding at 88 miles per hour from Back to the Future 1, getting sent back to 1985 as in the conclusion of the first movie.]

Marty 1: Doc!

[Marty 1 gets sent back to the future. 1955 Doc (1985 Doc has already gone back to 1885 due to the lightning strike) dances with delight because the experiment was successful.]

1955 Doc: AHHH!! AHH!! HA! HA! HAHAHA!

Marty II (the one that continues with us throughout this movie without us missing any events in his timeline) runs towards Doc.

Marty II: Doc! Doc! Doc! Doc! Doc! Doc spins around and sees him. He is in shock.

1955 Doc: AHH! [He hyperventilates]

Marty II: Okay, relax Doc, it's me, it's me, it's Marty!

1955 Doc: [He stops hyperventilating] No it can't be you...I just sent you back to the future.

Marty II: I know, you did send me back to the future, but I'm back, I'm back from the future!

1955 Doc: Great...Scott! [He faints.]

Marty II: Doc. C'mon.

[Credits roll for Back to the Future III.]

Marty is shown driving Doc in the pouring rain following the lightning, bringing him home. He hangs the letter from Doc in 1885 over the fire to dry. Then they show the next morning, with Marty sleeping in a chair with his feet on a stool over the hoverboard, and Doc lying sleeping on a couch. The TV has been on all night but hasn't been working because of the storm until now. Suddenly, TV service resumes.

TV: Hey kids what time is it? Howdy Doody time!

[Doc gets up and clutches his head.]

1955 Doc: Great Scott! Ooh...Howdy Doody time!

[Doc goes over to the recorder and begins recording his "Diary".]

1955 Doc: Date, Sunday, November 13th, 1955 7:01 AM. Last night's time travel experiment was apparently a complete success. Lightning struck the clock tower at precisely 10:04 pm sending the necessary 1.21 jigawatts into the time vehicle, which vanished in a brilliant flash of light leaving a pair of fire trails behind. I therefore assume that Marty and the time vehicle were transported forward through time into the year 1985. After that...after that...I can't recall what happened. In fact, I don't even remember how I got home! Perhaps the jigawatt discharge coupled with the temporal displacement field generated by the time vehicle caused a disruption of my own brain waves resulting in a condition of momentary amnesia. Indeed I now recall the moments after the time vehicle disappeared... into the future... I saw a vision of Marty saying, "I've come back from the future." [Marty gets out of his chair, with Doc’s back to him, and starts walking towards Doc] Undoubtedly this was some sort of subsequent imagery-

Marty II: Hey Doc. Doc. [Grinning, waving. Doc spins around and is in shock]

1955 Doc: DAAAAH! WAHAAAAAH!

[Doc trips over the hoverboard trying to get away from Marty, crashes into the organ, and is sitting on the keys. Discordant music comes from the organ.]

Marty II: Doc, calm down, OK? Just calm down, it's me, it's Marty.

1955 Doc: No! It can't be you, I just sent you back to the future!!

Marty II: But I came back from the future, remember? Last night you fainted... I brought ya home.

1955 Doc: [He stands up from the organ] This can't be happening! You can't be here! It doesn't make sense that you are here! I refuse to even believe you are here!

[Doc runs into bathroom, slams door leaving Marty outside.]

Marty II: I am here, and it does make sense. I came back to 1955 with the you from 1985 to get a book back from Biff. So once we got the book back, you...that is, the you from 1985...were in the DeLorean when it got struck by lightning and you got sent back to 1885!

1955 Doc: 1885? [Opens door] It's a very interesting story, Future Boy, but there's one little thing that doesn't make sense. If the me of the future is now in the past, how could you possibly know about it?

Marty II: You sent me a letter. [Shoves letter in Doc's face.]

[Scene: Doc's house a few minutes later. Doc is reading the letter.]

1955 Doc: "Dear Marty: If my calculations are correct, you will receive this letter immediately after you saw the DeLorean struck by lightning. First, let me assure you that I am alive and well. I have been living happily these past eight months in the year 1885. The lightning bolt that hit the DeLorean caused a jigawatt overload which scrambled the time circuits, activated the flux capacitor, and sent me back to 1885. The overload shorted out the time circuits and destroyed the flying circuits. Unfortunately, the car will never fly again." [He pauses at this and turns to Marty in amazement.] It actually flew?!

Marty II: Yeah, well, you had a hover conversion done in the early twenty-first century.

1955 Doc: Incredible! [He goes back to reading] "I set myself up as a blacksmith as a front while I attempted to repair the damage to the time circuits. Unfortunately, this proved impossible because suitable replacement parts will not be invented until [continues to the next page] 1947. However, I've gotten quite adept at shoeing horses and fixing wagons!" [Doc turns to Marty again] 1885! Amazing. I actually end up as a blacksmith in the Ol' West.

Marty II: [Grinning] Pretty heavy, huh?

1955 Doc: [continues reading] "I have buried the DeLorean in the Delgado mine adjacent to the old Boot Hill Cemetery as shown on the enclosed map. Hopefully it will remain undisturbed and preserved until you uncover it in 1955. Inside, you will find repair instructions. My 1955 counterpart" - that's me - "should have no problem repairing it so you can drive it back to the future. Once you have returned to 1985, destroy the time machine." [He looks to Marty questioningly] Destroy it?

Marty II: [Uncomfortably, he takes the model car from the first movie (the one Doc used to demonstrate how Marty 1 would return to 1985 and accidentally burned and threw in the wastebasket) from the trash can, looks at it and puts it back.] Yeah, well, it's a long story, Doc.

1955 Doc: "Do not - I repeat - do not attempt to come back here to get me. I am perfectly happy living in the fresh air and wide-open spaces, and I fear that unnecessary time travel only risks further disruption of the space-time continuum. And please take care of - Einstein for me." [Again, he turns to Marty with a question in his voice.] Einstein?

Marty II: He's your dog, Doc - Einstein - it's what you call your dog...in 1985. [He walks over to a chess set, in front of which Copernicus, Doc's 1955 dog, is sitting, and begins playing the game.]

1955 Doc: [Doc smirks and continues reading.] "I know you will give him a good home. Remember to walk him twice a day and that he only likes canned dog food. These are my wishes. Please respect them and follow them. And so, Marty, I now say farewell and wish you Godspeed. You've been a good, kind, and loyal friend to me, and you made a real difference in my life. I will always treasure our relationship, and will think on you with fond memories, warm feelings and a special place in my heart. Your friend in time, 'Doc.' Emmett L. Brown. September 1st, 1885."

1955 Doc: I never knew I could write anything so touching...

Marty II: [Standing up and going over to Doc] I know, I know Doc, it's beautiful.

[Copernicus whines]

1955 Doc: Oh, it's all right, Copernicus! Everything's gonna be fine.

Marty II: I'm sorry, Doc, it's all my fault you're stuck back there. I never should've let Biff get to me.

1955 Doc: There are plenty worse places to be than the Old West. I could've ended up in the Dark Ages. They probably would've burned me at the stake as a heretic or something. Let's look at the map. It says here the time vehicle is buried here in a side tunnel. We may have to blast.

[Scene: At Boot Hill Cemetery, Marty and Doc blow up the opening to the cave]

Marty II: Whoa. I think you woke up the dead with that blast. [Very ironic statement although Marty doesn't know it]

1955 Doc: Take this camera... I wanna document everything!

[Scene: Doc, Marty and Copernicus are inside the cave, using headlamps on hardhats trying to find the spot where the DeLorean is hidden]

1955 Doc: This reminds me of the time I attempted to reach the center of the earth. I'd be reading my favorite author, Jules Verne. I spent weeks preparing for the expedition, I didn't even get this far. Of course, I was only 12 at the time. It was the writings of Jules Verne that had a profound effect on my life. I was 11 when I first read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. That's when I realized that I must devote my life into science.

Marty II: Doc... check it out... look at this. [He finds a little cranny in the cave with wooden planks covering it, marked by an "ELB".]

Doc: My initials... just like in Journey to the Center of the Earth! That means the time machine must be right through this wall!

[Doc and Marty chop through with pickaxes and find the DeLorean, covered with a sheet, inside]

1955 Doc: [Sighs] It's been buried here for 70 years, 2 months, and 13 days. Astounding.

[Scene: Just outside the area in the cave where the DeLorean is hidden, Marty is reading the letter out loud, and Doc is staring with a magnifying glass at the time circuit control microchip.]

Marty II: "...As you can see, the lightning bolt shorted out the time circuit control microchip. The attached sche-sche..."

1955 Doc: Schematic.

Marty II: "...schematic diagram will allow you to build a replacement unit with the 1955 components, thus restoring the time machine to perfect working order."

1955 Doc: Unbelievable, that this piece of junk could be such a big problem. No wonder this circuit failed... it says, "Made in Japan."

Marty II: What do you mean, Doc? All the best stuff is made in Japan.

1955 Doc: Unbelievable!

[Scene: At night. Doc and Marty are outside the cave now, near the cemetery, loading stuff onto Doc's pickup truck (pickup truck? They had those in 1955?)]

1955 Doc: You know, when I was a kid, I always wanted to be a cowboy. Now, knowing I'll spend my future in the past it sounds like a wonderful way to spend my retirement years. It just occurred to me...since I end up in 1885 perhaps I'm now in the history books. I wonder...could I go to the library and look myself up in the old newspaper archives?

Marty II: I dunno, Doc, you're the one who's always saying, you know, it's not too good to know too much about your own destiny.

1955 Doc: You're right, Marty... I know too much already. Better that I not attempt to uncover the circumstances of my own... future. [Calling out for his dog, about to get into the truck] Copernicus! Come on, boy!

Marty II: I'll get him Doc. Copernicus!

[Copernicus is whining]

Marty II: Come on, let's go home, boy.

[Copernicus continues whining]

Marty II: What's wrong? What's wrong, Copernicus, come on, let's go home. Come on. [Marty finds Copernicus whining in front of a tombstone. He quickly shines the flashlight on the tombstone writing but doesn't seem to notice it, although to the audience it is quite clear that it is marked "Here Lies Emmett Brown." Seconds later, he returns carrying Copernicus keeping his flashlight on the tombstone]

Marty II: Doc! Doc! Come here! Quick!

[Doc runs out from the truck and sees Marty stooping at the tombstone]

1955 Doc: What's wrong, Marty? You look like you've seen a ghost.

Marty II: You're not far off, Doc. Look at this.

1955 Doc: [Apparently reading the tombstone and clutching his chest appearing to go into convulsions sees the tombstone] Oh! Great Scott!

Marty II: Check this out. "Died, September 7th, 1885." That's one week after you wrote the letter! "Erected in eternal memory by his beloved Clara." [Spins around to face Doc, stands up] Who the hell is Clara??!!

Doc: Marty, please don't stand there!!

Marty II: [steps off grave plot] Oh, right, sorry. I gotta get another picture. [Takes picture of tombstone]

Doc: "...shot in the back by Buford Tannen over a matter of 80 dollars!" What kind of a future do you call that?!

[Scene: Library at night, apparently the library is closed. Lights are turned off, the only light in the room is one of those desk-lamps Marty is standing at looking at old newspapers while Doc searches for more things]

Marty II: [Reading] "Buford Tannen was a notorious gunman whose short temper and a tendency to drool earned him the nickname Mad Dog. He was quick on the trigger and bragged that he had killed 12 men, not including Indians or Chinamen."

1955 Doc: Does it mention me? Am I one of the twelve?

Marty II: Just a minute. "However, this claim cannot be substantiated since precise records were not kept after Tannen shot a newspaper editor after printing an unfavorable story about him in 1884." That's why we can't find anything.

1955 Doc: [Bringing over a book of old family pictures] Look... William McFly and family. Your relatives?

Marty II: My great-grandfather's name was William. [Lays finger over photograph of his ancestor] That's him. Good looking guy. [Note: Michael J. Fox is playing Marty and, in the photograph, Michael J. Fox is also posing as William. Obviously, the writers are using this connection to make a joke]

1955 Doc: McFlys...but no Browns!

Marty II: Look, Doc, maybe it was a mistake. Maybe that grave wasn't yours. There could've been another Emmett Brown back in 1885. Did you have any relatives here back then?

1955 Doc: [Shaking head] The Browns came to Hill Valley in 1908, and then they were the Von Brauns. My father changed our name during the 1st World War.

Marty II: Doc! Look! [Thumbing through photos, he has found a picture of Doc on September 5, 1885 in front of the brand-new clock now in the clock tower]

1955 Doc: Oh! Great Scott! It's me! Then it is true. All of it. It is me who goes back there...and gets shot.

Marty II: It's not gonna happen Doc. [Doc looks at him quizzically] After you fix the time circuits and put new tires on the DeLorean, I'm goin’ back to 1885 and I'm bringin’ you home.

[Scene: At the Pohatchee drive-in outside of Hill Valley. Marty is in the bathroom getting dressed in a ridiculous looking Western costume while Doc is outside preparing the DeLorean]

1955 Doc: The clothes fit?

Marty II: [Calling out from inside] Yeah! Everything except the boots, Doc. They're kinda tight! I dunno, are you sure this stuff is authentic?

1955 Doc: Of course. Haven't you ever seen a Western?

Marty II: [Coming out, shown dressed in a ridiculous pink outfit probably used in early un-authentic Westerns] Yeah, I have Doc, but Clint Eastwood never wore anything like this.

1955 Doc: Clint who?

Marty II: That's right. [Points finger at a movie poster, the first Western movie starring Clint Eastwood] You haven't heard of him yet.

1955 Doc: Marty, you have to wear the boots. You can't wear those futuristic things in 1885. You shouldn't even be wearing them in 1955. [Indicating his Nikes]

Marty II: All right, Doc, look. Once I get there I'll put them on, I promise.

1955 Doc: Okay, I think we're about ready. I put gas in the tank, your future clothes are packed, just in case—fresh batteries for your walkie-talkies. Oh, and what about that floating device?

Marty II: Hoverboard.

1955 Doc: Alright. [Picking up Hoverboard and putting it in the DeLorean]

Marty II: You know Doc, it's gonna be a hell of a long walk back to Hill Valley from here.

1955 Doc: It's still the safest plan. After all, we can't risk sending you back to a populated area, or to a spot that's geographically unknown. You don't wanna crash into some trees that once existed in the past. This is all completely open country! So you'll have plenty of run-off space when you arrive. Remember where you're going there are no roads. There's a small cave over there which will be a perfect place to hide the time vehicle. Well, the new time circuit control tubes are warmed up! Starting up DeLorean. Time circuits on. I wrote the letter on September 1st, so we'll send you back the very next day. September 2nd, that's a Wednesday. September 2nd, 1885, 8 AM. I get shot on Monday the 7th, so you have 5 days to locate me. According to my letter I'm a blacksmith, so I probably have a shop somewhere. [Calling out] All you have to do is drive the time vehicle directly towards that screen accelerating at 88 miles per hour.

Marty II: Wait a minute, Doc. If I drive straight towards the screen, I'll crash into those Indians. [Indicating a mural painting of Indians behind the movie screen]

1955 Doc: Marty. You're not thinking fourth dimensionally! You'll instantly be transported to 1885, and those Indians won't even be there.

Marty II: Right.

1955 Doc: Well, good luck, for both of our sakes. See you in the future. [Pats Marty on the shoulder]

Marty II: You mean the past.

1955 Doc: Exactly! [Running out away from DeLorean near the small building with bathrooms. He will use a pistol to start Marty off] Happy trails Marty! Ready Marty?

Marty II: [Starting up car] Ready!

1955 Doc: Set!

Marty II: [Mumbling while he pulls the lever into driving mode] Hi ho silver.

[Doc shoots pistol. Marty drives toward the screen. The Back to the Future theme is played]

1955 Doc: Vaya con Dios!

[Marty is transported through time right before he is about to crash into the Indian mural. He figures the Indians are gone, but he sees ahead, a tribe of REAL war Indians whooping and riding directly towards him]

Marty II: INDIANS!

[Now the audience can hear the Indian drumbeat]

Marty II: AHHHH!! [He spins around for a while and finally spots the cave Doc had talked about earlier] The cave! [He drives toward the cave and watches the Indians and their horses leaping over the cave away from something. Marty, thinking he's safe, ventures out and climbs up to see nothing. Suddenly he hears a trumpet playing and a bunch of soldiers riding directly towards him]

Marty II: Shit, the cavalry!! [Gets back into cave. Once he sees that the coast is clear, he looks over the DeLorean and sees an arrow that an Indian shot into the car. He pulls it out and stoops to look underneath and sees liquid dripping from the bottom of the car] Damn, I ripped the fuel line.

[He opens the DeLorean wing doors and takes out his boots and a tiny photo of Doc's tombstone, stuffing the latter in his back pocket. He stands there for a moment, not doing anything. Suddenly he hears the sound of a bear roaring. He looks up to see a giant brown bear standing only a few yards away from him]

Marty II: AHHH!! AHH!!

[Bear roars again and stands up on hind legs]

Marty II: AHH!! AH! AH! OH! OH! [He runs away from the bear and out of the cave, dropping his boots along the way. The bear sniffs curiously at the boots and stops, nosing through them. Marty, however, keeps running while looking at the bear and trips, sliding down a hill. He tries to stop but he can't. UH! He crashes at the bottom of the hill on a farmer's fence and instantly passes out]

Seamus: Maggie! [We see a boot shot of Seamus first, then the rest of his body. He is also played by Michael J. Fox. He talks with an Irish accent] Fetch some water, we got a hurt man here!

[Scene: Darkened room with bed]

Marty II: Mom...Mom, is that you?

Woman's Voice with Irish accent: There there now, you've been asleep for nearly 6 hours now.

Marty II: I had this horrible nightmare. It was terrible. I dreamed I was in a western...I was being chased by Indians. And a bear.

Woman's Voice: Well, you're safe and sound, here now at the McFly farm.

Marty II: McFly farm! AHH!! [Sits up in bed. He is in a log cabin, a single room with a bed. The woman is sitting at a desk on a chair near the bed] Well you're my-my - my... [suddenly realizing that although he knows the last name, he doesn't know which member of the family this is] Who are you?

Woman: Name's McFly. Maggie McFly.

Marty II: McFly?!?! [Gulping] Maggie?!?!

Maggie: That's Mrs. McFly, and don't you be forgettin' the Mrs.! And what might your name be sir?

Marty II: Well, it's Mc- [Suddenly realizing he shouldn't let her know that they are related. Marty recalls the conversation he had with Doc in 1955] ...Eastwood...uh...Clint...Clint Eastwood? [Grinning sheepishly]

Maggie: No-nonsense, practically. You hit your head, Mr. Eastwood. Not too serious, but lucky for you, Seamus found you when he did.

Marty II: [Incredulously] Seamus?!?!

Maggie: Me husband. [Explaining. Gets up to leave the room] You'll be excusin’ me Mr. Eastwood, while I tend to William.

Marty II: William. [He gets up and checks to see that his pants are still on (after all, that episode in the first movie wasn't too pretty.) He goes out to see Maggie bouncing a crying baby in her arms, cooing]

Marty II: That's William?

Maggie: Aye! William Shaun McFly, the first of our family to be born in America! Ahh, it’s okay Will! Here's Mr. Clint Eastwood...visitin’. [William is staring at Marty and has stopped crying. Maggie looks at Marty] He already likes ya, Mr. Eastwood.

[The door flies open]

Seamus: Maggie. [Slams a dead deer down on the table] I got supper.

[Scene: The McFly Farm Dinner Table]

Seamus: I'm not one to pry into a man's personal affairs but… how is it that you came to be way out here, without a horse? Or boots? Or a hat?

Marty II: Well, my car — horse broke down and a bear ate my boots. And I guess I just forgot my hat.

Maggie: How could you forget a thing like your hat? Would you like some water?

Marty II: Yeah, thanks. [Maggie pours him a glass of brown water. Marty stares at it]

Seamus: I'll tell you what I'll do, Mr. Eastwood. I'll help you find your blacksmith friend. You can stay the night in the barn. And tomorrow, I'll take ya as far as the railroad tracks...you can follow 'em straight on in into town. [Marty spits out seeds from some sort of bread onto his plate]. I'll even give you a hat.

[Maggie slams down plate at the kitchen counter, and crosses herself in the Catholic fashion]

Marty II: That's great. Thanks.

[William begins crying again and Seamus gets up to hold him]

Seamus: Ahh. Woogie William. Woogie William. Ohh, yes. [Sits down at table again with William and talks to Marty] I think you'll find the barn comfortable. I've never had any complaints about it from the pigs. [Laughs]

Maggie: [Sternly] Seamus. A word with you.

Seamus: Aye. [Stands up and reaches his full arms out to Marty] Will ya hold him for a minute? [He hands William to Marty (MICHAEL J. FOX TO MICHAEL J. FOX!!) and then goes to the corner of the room to talk to Maggie]

Maggie: You sure you're not after bringin’ a curse on this house, takin’ him in like that? Such a strange young man.

Seamus: Aye, but I've just got a feelin’ about him Maggie. It's the right thing to do. It's important. Look how the baby takes to him. Little Will never takes to strangers. It's almost as if...he's connected to us.

Marty II: [Talking to the baby] Hey, Will. So, you're my great- grandfather...the first McFly born in America. [Raises Will up to see urine pouring between his legs] And you peed on me.

[Scene: Near the train station. Marty is walking toward a sign. He whistles in respect and walks on through into a bustling town. The camera pans up and over a sign on the station house that reads "Hill Valley." He walks around and there are lots of shots of the town in 1885. In the area where there used to be a Statler Toyota, there now is a sign reading "Honest Joe Statler - fine horses." He sees some men working]

Man #1: Give me some soap, Wang.

Wang: Here you go.

[He sees a bathing house and a butcher chopping meat. He sees a banner above that advertises the "Hill Valley Festival" on September 5th, 1885, for the dedication of the clock tower. He sees an A. Jones Manure wagon on the side of the road. He sees a Wells Fargo horse-drawn wagon driving by. Marty then sees the clock tower that he destroys in 1955 being built in the square in 1885]

Wagon Driver: Hyah!

[Marty jumps out of the way right before the carriage runs over him. There is a clearing of dust, and we see Marty staring at his Nikes, now covered with horse poop. He walks into the saloon]

[Scene: Inside the saloon. Three old men (Levi, Zeke and Jeb) are sitting at a table in the saloon talking amongst themselves]

Old Timer #1 (Levi): Take a look at what just breezed in the door.

Old Timer #2 (Zeke): Why, I didn't know the circus was in town!

Old Timer #3 (Jeb): Looks like he got that shirt off'n a dead Chi-nee.

[Levi laughs]

Bartender: [To Marty] What'll it be, stranger?

Marty II: Uh...I'll have...uh...ice water.

Levi: Ice water? [Laughs]

Chester: Water? You want water, you better go dunk ya head in the horse trough out there. [Old Timers laugh] In here... we pour whiskey. [He takes out a bottle of whiskey and pours a small glass. Marty stares at it. There is steam coming from the glass]

Marty II: Excuse me.

Chester: For what?

Marty II: I'm tryna find a blacksmith.

Voice: Hey McFly... thought I done told you never to come in... [We see that it is a mean looking cowboy with a gang behind him] You ain't Seamus McFly. [Walking towards the counter] You look like him though. 'Specially with that dog ugly hat. [His gang laughs. Marty rolls his eyes at his hat and takes it off] You kin to that hay barber? [Marty doesn't reply. He just stares] What's your name, dude?

Marty II: Uh...Mart– [Realizing his mistake, he tries again] Eastwood. Clint Eastwood.

Gang Leader: What kinda stupid name is that?

Gang Member: I'd say he's the runt of the litter.

Gang Member: [Going over to Marty, shaking his jaw and showing off Marty's teeth] Take a look, see at these pearly whites! Hell, I ain't seen teeth that straight weren't store bought.

Gang Member: [Indicating his Nikes] Take a look at them moccasins. What kind of skins is them? What's that writin’ mean...Neekay...what is that, some sort of Injun talk or somethin’? [Laughs]

Gang Leader: [Chester begins pouring out whiskey but gang leader stops him. With the barrel of his gun] Bartender...I'm lookin’ for that no-good cheatin' blacksmith. You seen him?

Chester: [Scared, backing away] No, sir, Mr. Tannen, I have not.

Marty II: Tannen. You're Mad Dog Tannen.

Buford (formerly Gang Leader, we now know his name): Mad Dog? [Everyone in the saloon runs and hides, but Marty stays where he is] I hate that name. I hate it, ya hear? Nobody calls me Mad Dog. 'Specially not some, duded-up, egg suckin’, gutter trash. [He points a gun at Marty's feet and shoots, causing Marty to jump to save his feet]

Marty II: AHH!

Buford: Dance! [Fires shot] Come on! [Fires shot, gang members laughing hysterically]Come on, runt, you can dance - [fires shot] - 'better than that!

[Marty keeps his feet going in case while the dust clears. When it does clear, we notice that he's doing Michael Jackson's moonwalk while softly singing Michael Jackson’s "Billie Jean"]

Marty II: Uh...uh...Billie Jean is not my lover- [kicking feet] -whoo!

[He jumps on an end of a wooden floorboard, sending a spittoon of urine and tobacco spit at the other end, spilling all over Buford. Buford draws his gun, points and clicks - but nothing happens. He's out of bullets. Marty scrambles to get out but trips underneath the old timers' table]

Levi: You better run, squirrel!

Buford: Y'all, get him!!!

[Marty, climbing over tables and chairs and swinging from chandeliers, hops his way out of the saloon with the gang following close behind. He runs like mad]

Marty II: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

[The chase continues. However, since the gang and Buford are on horses, they catch up to him faster. Buford swings a rope with a ring on the end a couple times like a lasso and then he throws it over Marty's neck, dragging him the rest of the way towards the clock tower. His gang, in delight, fires shot guns and laughs.]

Marty II: Ahh!!

Buford: We got ourselves a new courthouse...high time we had a hangin'!

[Marty sees what they're trying to do]

Marty II: Oh, oh God, hu...

[They tighten the noose on his neck and hoist him up on the rope so that he is hanging from the courthouse with his hands and feet dangling in the air. Buford and his gang laugh hysterically. In the distance, a tall man in boots and a long coat with a long gun steps slowly up towards the mini riot. Neither Marty nor the gang has seen him yet]

Buford: Haven't had a hangin’ in a long time!

[The man points and clicks. A loud boom is heard and apparently, he's shot Marty out of the air so he has now been saved. He falls with a thud, however unharmed, to the ground. The gang looks at the man for the first time and raises their guns. Who is it? It’s none other than Doc!]

Doc: It'll shoot the fleas off a dog’s back at 500 yards, Tannen, and it’s pointed straight at your head!!

[Buford motions that he wants to speak with Doc alone to his gang, and they put their guns down. He rides slowly towards Doc on his horse]

Buford: You owe me money, blacksmith.

Doc: How do ya figure?

Buford: My horse threw his shoe. Seein' you was the one who done the shoein’, I say that makes you responsible.

Doc: Well since you never paid me for the job, I say that makes us even!

Buford: Wrong! See I was on my horse when he threw his shoe and I got throwed off. And that caused me to bust a perfectly good bottle of fine Kentucky Redeye. So the way I figure it, blacksmith, you owe me five dollars for the whiskey, and seventy-five dollars for the horse.

Marty II: [Realizing this is why Doc is going to be killed. He can barely speak, so he whispers hoarsely] That's the eighty dollars!

Doc: Look, if your horse threw his shoe, bring him back and I'll re-shoe ’im!

Buford: I done shot that horse!

Doc: Well that's your problem, Tannen!

Buford: Wrong. That's yours. So from now on, you better be lookin' behind you when you walk. 'Cause one day you gonna get a bullet in yo' back. Let's go!

[His gang makes a noisy departure, leaving Doc and Marty alone for the first time. Marty whispers hoarsely again]

Marty II: Doc...

Doc: [sternly] Marty...I gave you explicit instructions not to come here but to go directly back to 1985.

Marty II: I know Doc...but I had to come.

Doc: But it’s good to see ya, Marty.

[Marty and Doc exchange hugs]

Doc: Marty, you're gonna have to do something about those clothes. You walk around town dressed like that, you're liable to get shot.

Marty II: [Making a tightening gesture around his own neck] Or hanged.

Doc: What idiot dressed you in that outfit?

Marty II: [Clapping his hand on Doc's shoulder and smiling for the first time] You did.

[Scene: Blacksmith shop/barn. Marty is changing into real nineteenth- century Western clothes]

Doc: [Studying tombstone picture with the magnifying glass] "Shot in the back by Buford Tannen over a matter of 80 dollars?!?!?" September seventh! That's this Monday! Now I wish I'd paid him off! [He points to the text at the bottom of the tombstone and talks to Marty] 'And who’s this beloved Clara? I don't know anyone named Clara.

Marty II: I dunno, Doc. I thought maybe she was a girlfriend of yours.

Doc: [Looking at Marty like he is stupid] Marty. My involvement in such a social relationship, here in 1885, the result is a disruption of the space-time continuum. As a scientist, I can never take that risk, certainly not after everything we've already been through.

Man outside: Emmett! Ho, Emmett!

Doc: [Looking out the open door] Hubert! [Speaking towards Marty in the back of the room] It's the mayor!

Mayor Hubert: [Coming just inside the door] Excuse me, Emmett. You remember last week at the town meeting when you volunteered to meet the new school teacher at the station when she came in?

Doc: Oh yes, quite so.

Mayor: Well, we just got word she's comin' in tomorrow. Here are the details for ya. [He gives Doc a sheet of paper] Thanks for all your help.

Doc: [Walking towards Marty, calling out] Anytime, Hubert!

Mayor: Oh, her name's Miss Clayton. Clara Clayton.

[Doc looks up in a state of confusion, putting two and two together. The Mayor leaves before Marty finally speaks]

Marty II: Well, Doc, now we know who Clara is.

Doc: [Looking at Marty with a weird grin on his face] Marty. It's impossible. The idea that I could fall in love at first sight? It's romantic nonsense. There's no scientific rationale for that.

Marty II: [Laughing] C'mon, Doc, it's not science. You meet the right girl, it just hits ya; it's like lightning.

Doc: [Climbing a ladder on a giant machine he's made] Marty, please don't say that!

Marty II: [Calling out] That's the way it was for me and Jennifer. Man, we couldn't keep our eyes off each other! God, Jennifer, damn, I hope she's alright, Doc. I can't believe we just left her there on the porch!

Doc: Don't worry, Marty, she'll be fine. When you burned the almanac in 1955, the normal timeline was restored. That means once we're back in 1985, you just have to go over to her house and wake her up.

[The giant machine begins tooting]

Doc: Oh, Marty, turn that valve over there all the way to the right. Yeah, turn it all the way around. Okay, let's go!

[The machine rattles for a while. Doc holds a bowl under a chute where something is going to shoot out of the machine. A small, brownish solid similar to ice comes out. Doc picks it up with a pair of tongs and drops it into a long beaker of cooled tea. He rattles it and offers it to Marty]

Doc: Iced tea?

Marty II: No, thanks. [Doc takes a swig. Marty looks incredulously at the giant machine] It's a refrigerator!

Doc: [Moving away from his invention] Well, I guess Miss Clayton will have to find other transportation. [Turning to face Marty] If I never meet the woman, there's no possibility of a romantic infatuation, right?

Marty II: You're the doc, Doc.

Doc: Alright. Let's get the DeLorean and get ourselves back to the future! [Puts on hat]

Marty II: [Casually] Oh listen, Doc, I tore a hole in the gas tank when I was landin’ so we’re gonna have to patch it up and get some gas.

Doc: [Frozen in place, expression changes] You mean we're outta gas?

Marty II: [Still unaware of what's wrong] Yeah, no big deal, we got Mr. Fusion, right?

Doc: Mr. Fusion powers the time circuits and the flux capacitor. But the internal combustion engine runs on ordinary gasoline; it always has. There's not gonna be a gas station around here until sometime in the next century. Without gasoline, we can't get the DeLorean up to 88 miles per hour.

Marty: [Facing mirror] So, what'll we do?

[Scene: Outside Hill Valley, Marty and Doc sitting on the roof of the DeLorean being pulled by a pack of horses]

Marty II: Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh!

Doc: Ya! Ya! [Using whip]

Marty II: [Reading their speed off a speedometer] 24!

Doc: It's no use, Marty! Even the fastest horse in the world can't run more than 35, 40 miles an hour.

Doc: Ya! Ya! Ya!

[Scene: Blacksmith shop. Doc is pouring purple liquid into the front of the car (the part with all the mechanical stuff) and Marty's trying to start the car]

Marty II: Bartender says that's the strongest stuff they got.

Doc: Try it, Marty.

[Marty tries to start the car; it stalls but then there is a bubbling noise coming from the back of the car]

Doc: Give it more gas...

[There is a loud boom. Something pops out of the bottom of the back of the DeLorean]

Doc: Damn! It blew the fuel injection manifold. Strong stuff all right. [Sheepishly handing the broken part to Marty] It'll take me a month to rebuild it.

Marty II: A month? Doc, you're gonna get shot on Monday!

Doc: [Has moved toward a desk near the window facing the railroad tracks; there is a calendar with the date next to the desk. He faces Marty, back to window] I know, I know, I know! I wish...wait. I've got it! We can roll it down a steep hill...no, we'd never find a smooth enough surface. Unless...of course...ice. [Eyes widening] We can wait until winter...when the lake freezes over...

Marty II: Winter! Doc! Monday! It's three days away!

Doc: [Trying to come up with another solution] Wait. Let's just think this thing through logically. We know it can't run on its own power, and we know we can't pull it. But if we can figure out a way to push it up to 88 mph...huh?

[The train whistle blows outside. Doc turns to look outside for the first time and sees a large black steam train pulling into the station]

Doc: That's it!

[Scene: Next to the train with the engineer]

Engineer: How fast can she go? Why, I've had her up to 55 myself. I hear that fearless Frank Fargo got one of these up to near 70 out past Verde Junction.

Marty II: Is it possible to get it up to 90?

Engineer: Ha. 90? Tarnation, son, who’d ever need to be in such a hurry?

Doc: Well, it's just a little bet that he and I have, that's all. Theoretically speaking, could it be done?

Engineer: Well, I suppose if you had a straight stretch of track with a level grade, and you weren't haulin’ no cars behind ya...and if ya could get the fire hot enough...and I’m talkin’ about hotter than the blazes of hell and damnation itself...then yes, it might be possible to get her up that fast.

Doc: Tell me, when’s the next train come through here?

Engineer: [Matter-of-factly] Monday mornin’ at 8 o'clock.

[Scene: At the train station, studying a map on the wall of Hill Valley]

Doc: Here. [Slams finger on map] This spur that runs off the main line 3 miles down to Clayton Ravine. There's a long stretch of level track that will still exist in 1985. This is where we'll push the DeLorean with the locomotive. [Leaning against the wall] Funny, this map calls Clayton Ravine Shonash Ravine. That must be an old Indian name for it. [Facing map again] It's perfect. Nice long run that goes clear across the bridge over the ravine, you know, over near that Hilldale housing development?

Marty II: Right, Doc, but according to this map... [indicating map] ...there is no bridge.

[Scene: On the railroad tracks near the ravine. There is a dead end and a sign that reads "Shonash Ravine Bridge - Scheduled to be Completed Summer 1886". The railroad tracks just stop at the edge of the ravine. Marty and Doc are walking back from visiting the edge]

Marty II: Well, Doc, we can scratch that idea. I mean, we can't wait around a year and a half for this thing to get finished.

Doc: Marty...it's perfect! You're just not thinking fourth dimensionally!

Marty II: [Mumbling, probably thinking, "Where have I heard that before?"] Right, right. I have a real problem with that.

Doc: Don't you see? The bridge will exist in 1985. It's safe and still in use. Therefore, as long as we get the DeLorean up to 88 miles per hour before we hit the edge of the ravine, we'll instantaneously arrive at a point in time where the bridge is completed. We'll have track under us, and coast safely across the ravine!

Marty II: What about the locomotive?

Doc: [Grinning] It'll be a spectacular wreck. Too bad no one will be around to see it.

Woman: [In the background] Ahhh!! Help me!

Doc: [Turns to see a woman in the distance riding on a buckboard with horses speeding wildly out of control and headed straight for the edge of Shonash Ravine] Great Scott! [He kicks his horse] Git!

Marty II: [He motions his horse to get moving] Hah!

Doc: [Speeds toward the woman on his horse (still not seeing her face) and motions her to get off the wagon] Jump!

[Just in time, the woman climbs out of the wagon and into Doc's arms. The horses neigh and suddenly gallop toward the left, leaving the wagon to fall off the edge of the ravine]

Doc: [Calming his horse down] Whoa.

Woman: [Her hat sits jauntily on her head, covering her face] Oh, thank you, sir, you saved my... [she lifts her hat for the first time and sees Doc. Stunned she cannot speak for a moment] ...life.

Doc: [Doc stares at her too. His eyes grow wide. Apparently he's fallen in love with this woman] Emmett Brown, at your service, Miss...

Woman: Um...um...Clayton. Clara Clayton.

[The camera points towards Marty, who whips out the tombstone photo from his pocket and stares at it, his eyes moving quickly from the photo back to the two in front of him]

Doc: Clara. [He pauses for a moment] What a beautiful name.

[The three are riding toward Clara's cabin, with Marty a little behind the other two- and one horse is carrying Clara's supplies. Doc and Marty take the supplies off the horse's back and put them on the porch of Clara's cabin]

Doc: May I help you inside with these?

Clara: Oh no, that won't be necessary. You've done more than enough already.

Doc: But it's really no trouble.

Marty II: Doc, she says it's fine, and we gotta get goin'. [Looks up at Clara] Ma'am, good luck with the school teachin' and everything.

Doc: Clara, I'll straighten everything out with Mr. Statler for the buckboard rental... don't you worry about that. I feel somewhat responsible for what happened.

Clara: Oh, well, that would be very gentlemanly of you, Mr. Brown...Emmett. You know, I'm almost glad that snake spooked those horses. Otherwise, we might never have met. I suppose it was destiny. [Doc stares at her unbelievingly] Well, thank you for everything.

Doc: You're quite welcome.

Clara: I will...see you again, won't I?

Doc: [Casually, but knowing he is lying] Of course, you'll see lots of me, I'm sure, I have a shop in town. I'm a local scientist...uh...uh...uh…blacksmith.

Clara: Science? What sort of science? Astronomy? Chemistry?

Doc: [Enchanted again by Clara] Actually I'm a student of all sciences.

Marty II: Hey Doc, we gotta get goin'.

Doc: Oh yes, well, excuse us Clara, we have to get...going. [He backs out from the path to Clara's cabin and closes the small gate. He then waves with a ridiculous look on his face] Toodle-oo.

[Clara waves back and Marty and Doc get on their horses and start riding away from her house]

Marty II: What do ya mean, you're gonna be seein' lots of her, Doc?

Doc: Well...I might see her again, just in passing.

Marty II: [Laughing] C'mon, Doc, did you see the way she was looking at you?

Doc: [Admittingly] Well, she did have quite a scare, right? After all, Miss Clayton almost ended up at the bottom of Clayton Ravine. [The words register as he speaks them] Clayton Ravine...

Marty II: [Apparently it registers with him, too] Holy shit! Hey Doc! Clayton Ravine was named after a teacher. [Doc turns to stare at him, He continues explaining] They say she fell in there a hundred years ago.

Doc: [Incredulously] A hundred years ago?!? That's this year!

Marty: [Continuing] Every kid in school knows that story because we all have teachers we'd like to see fall into the ravine.

Doc: Great Scott! [He stops his horse] Then she was supposed to go over in that wagon...and now, I may have seriously altered history. [He sits there hopelessly]

Marty: Look, Doc, what's the worst that could happen, huh? So they don't name the ravine after her. Let's just get the DeLorean ready and get the hell outta here.

Doc: [Ignoring Marty] I wish I'd never invented that infernal time machine...which caused nothing but disaster. [He rides slowly away. Marty pauses for a moment, looking at Doc curiously, then continues as well]

[Scene: Blacksmith shop]

Marty II: [Speaking into walkie-talkie from one end of the room] Doc, Doc, this is Marty. Can you read me? Over.

Doc: [Speaking into walkie-talkie from the other end, working on the tires of the DeLorean] Check, Marty.

Marty: [Into walkie-talkie] Great Doc, these things still work.

Doc: Alright. [Doc moves toward a model railroad he has built and Marty advances toward it from the opposite direction] Marty, once more let’s go over the entire plan and layout. I apologize for the crudity of this model...

Marty II: [Remembering 1955 Doc's model of Hill Valley square the night of the thunderstorm]. Yeah, I know, Doc, it's not to scale. It's okay, Doc.

Doc: Alright. Tomorrow night, Sunday, we'll load the DeLorean on to the tracks here on the spur right by the old, abandoned silver mine. The switch track is where the spur runs off the main line 3 miles into Clayton...Shonash Ravine. The train leaves the station at 8:00 Monday morning. We'll stop it here, uncouple the cars from the tender, throw the switch track, and hijack — borrow the locomotive and use it to push the time machine. According to my calculations we'll hit 88 miles per hour just before we hit the edge of the ravine, at which point we'll instantaneously arrive in 1985 and coast safely across the completed bridge.

Marty II: What does this mean? [Indicating a small sign Doc has made out of cardboard near the end of the railroad] Point of no return?

Doc: That's our failsafe point. Up until that point we can stop the locomotive before it plunges over the ravine. But once we pass that windmill, it's the future or bust.

[Scene: Blacksmith shop near model railroad]

Doc: Here you go, Marty. Connect that to the positive terminal. All right, Marty, you all set?

Marty II: Yeah, yeah, go.

Doc: Train pulling out of the station! Coming up the switch track! Stop at the switch track! Throw switch! Pulling up to the DeLorean! [Pushing lever further and further downward] Pushing the DeLorean up to 88 miles per hour! [The model train falls off the table with the model car and onto a pillow on the ground. Doc catches the model DeLorean before it hits the ground] It couldn't be simpler!

[There is a knock on the door]

Woman's Voice: Hello? Emmett?

[Doc goes to see who is at the door. He turns to Marty]

Doc: It's Clara! Quick, cover the DeLorean. [Marty and Doc busy themselves throwing a sheet over the DeLorean and Marty hides the model car behind his back. Clara opens the door herself and invites herself in]

Clara: Hello.

Doc: Why, hello. This is quite a surprise.

Clara: Well, I hope I'm not disturbing anything.

Doc: Oh no, we were just doing a little model railroading. [Walking over toward the model railroad]

Clara: Emmett, when my bags were thrown from the wagon, my telescope was damaged. And...since you expressed an interest...in science, I thought you might be able to repair it for me. [She pauses] I would pay you, of course.

Doc: [Quickly] Oh, no, no, no, I wouldn't think of charging you for this. [Marty sighs and runs his hand through his hair] Well, let's have a look at it. [He opens the telescope case Clara has brought and takes out the long device. He puts it in front of his eye and closes the other]

Clara: I think a lens may be out of alignment, because if ya move it this way, the image turns fuzzy, see? [She moves closer to Doc and gently moves the telescope in one direction] But if you turn it... the other way..

Doc: [Doc moves the telescope from his eyes and lowers his hand. He turns to face Clara. They gaze at each other] ...everything becomes... clear.

[It is apparent that they will probably kiss if they stand much longer at in this position. Marty is shown a few yards away in between the two characters. He clears his throat loudly. Doc and Clara look away from each other quickly. Clara moves a few steps toward the door and Doc takes on a queer position holding the telescope right in front of him with an idiotic look on his face]

Doc: I will repair it right away and have it for you tonight.

Clara: Oh, tonight's the town festival. I wouldn't dream of having you work on my telescope during such an important event. You are...planning on attending, aren't you?

Marty II: Well, actually ma'am...

Doc: Of course, the festival... [Marty looks at him strangely but doesn't say anything]

Clara: Well, in that case, I'll see you this evening at the festival, Emmett. [She walks toward the door and acknowledges Marty] Mr. Eastwood.

Marty II: Ma'am.

Clara: [Suddenly turning back to look at Doc] Thank you...for taking care of my telescope.

Doc: You're quite welcome. [Clara exits and Doc has the stupidest look on his face that anyone's ever seen. Marty goes up to him after a moment]

Marty II: It's a nice telescope.

[Scene: Hill Valley town center - Night. The townspeople are all gathered around for the dedication of the clock]

Mayor: Ladies and gentlemen! As mayor of Hill Valley, it gives me great pleasure to dedicate this clock to the people of Hill County. May it stand for all time! [Clapping and cheering] Tell me when, gentlemen!

Townspeople: 3...2...1...now!

[The mayor starts the clock that will eventually end up in the clock tower and be destroyed 70 years later. There are fireworks]

Mayor: Let the festivities begin!

[Doc and Marty are watching the festivities from a few yards away from everyone else]

Doc: Y'know Marty, in a way it's fitting that you and I are here to witness this.

Marty II: [Marty flashes a smile] Too bad I didn't bring my camera.

[Just then there is a great flash of light and click near the clock. The nineteenth century photographer is taking pictures of people near the clock. Marty and Doc look at each other.]

[Scene: In front of the clock]

Photographer: Ready, gentlemen?

Doc: [to Marty while facing the camera] The only problem is we'll never be able to show it to anybody.

Marty II: Smile, Doc.

[There is a great flash of light again. It looks like Marty and Doc have gone blind!]

[Scene: The Town Festival - The Dance. ZZ Top is "acting" as the nineteenth century band at the dance]

ZZ Top Member: YEE HA!!

[The music begins. Doc and Marty are again, aside. They aren't dancing, just watching the festivities from the sidelines]

Doc: What great music!

Marty II: Yeah; it's got a beat, and you can dance to it!

Colt Gun Salesman: Step right up, gentlemen, and test your mettle with the latest products from Colonel Samuel Colt's Patent firearms of Hartford, Connecticut. Take this model for example. [Marty turns and watches the Colt gun demonstration. Doc doesn't; he ventures out to see the sights] The new, improved and refined Colt Peacemaker. Available to you tonight for the low, low price of $12.

[Doc sees Clara talking with some people. He smiles in anticipation. Clara finally notices him and smiles back, advancing toward him]

Doc: Good evening.

Clara: Evening.

Doc: You look very...nice.

Clara: Thank you.

Doc: [He observes the festivities for a moment and then stutters in hesitation] Would you like...uh...would you care to, uh...

Clara: [Without hesitation, reassuring Doc] I'd love to.

[Doc and Clara go out toward the dance floor]

[Scene: Still on the sidelines of the dance, Marty is still observing the Colt gun demonstration]

Colt Gun Salesman: [turning to Marty] Young man, wanna give it a try?

Marty II: No, no, thanks. [He turns to speak to Doc, unaware that he's already been gone awhile] Hey Doc, this... [He notices that Doc isn't there and his eyes move to the dance floor]

Colt Gun Salesman: [Not giving up so easily] Son! Sonny boy! [Marty is oblivious to the salesman's desire for attention. He notices Doc and Clara on the dance floor and his shocked to see them begin dancing]

Marty II: The doc can dance?!

Colt Gun Salesman: Son! Son! Son! [He nudges Marty's shoulder with the barrel of the loaded gun (ooh, that's rough). Marty finally turns around] Hey! I just told you that even a baby can handle this weapon. Surely you're not afraid to try somethin' that a baby can do.

Marty II: Hey, I'm not afraid of nothin'.

Colt Gun Salesman: [Triumphant] Well, then, step right up like a man. [Hands Marty a gun in front of a little diorama of the Old West in a box. It looks almost like an old-fashioned video game to Marty] Now, what you do is just ease that hammer back there and squeeze off a round. [Marty points it to the diorama but the man shakes his head and guides his hand upward] No, no, no, right on out there and be real smooth. That's how you do it.

[Marty obviously shoots way off the mark into the sky]

Colt Gun Salesman: [thinking Marty is pathetic and chuckling] Ho ho. God.

Marty II: [Suddenly recognizing the similarities to a video game (although we don't know it yet)] Hey listen, can I try that again?

Colt Gun Salesman: Sure, go ahead. [Still chuckling]

[Marty shoots four or five times in succession. His marksmanship is so fantastic it stuns the salesman. He flips it back to the man]

Colt Gun Salesman: Hey, just tell me one thing...where'd you learn to shoot like that?

Marty: [In all seriousness] 7-Eleven.

Scene: Outside the festival - the entrance.

[Buford Tannen and his gang approach the festival on horseback]

Gang Member #1: Buford, you sure that blacksmith is gon' be at this here shindig?

Buford: Sure he's here. [His voice growing dark] Everybody's here tonight.

Deputy Marshall: You gentlemen are gonna have to check your firearms if you wanna join in on the festivities.

Buford: [Laughs] And who's gonna make us, tenderfoot...you?

Marshall Strickland: I am. [Buford turns to see Marshall Strickland to his left side, holding a long rifle near Tannen's shoulder]

Buford: Marshall Strickland. I didn't know you was back in town.

Marshall: If you can't read the sign, Tannen, I presume you can read this. [He pats his rifle]

Buford: Pretty tough hombre when you're pointin' a scattergun at a man's back.

Marshall: Just like you, Tannen, I take every advantage I can get. Now are you gonna check your iron?

Buford: [Backing down] I was just jokin' with your deputy. Of course I'm gonna check my iron. We all were, weren't we boys? [Laughing, they give all their guns up]

Deputy: Yeah. Right.

Deputy: Tannen...your knife, too.

Buford: [Angered, he takes the knife that was concealed in his boot and throws it like a dart onto a table nearby. Then he faces the Marshall] Smile, Marshall. After all, this is a party.

Marshall: [Still not moving his gun] The only party I'll be smilin' at is the one that sees you at the end of a rope. [Buford and the Marshall glare at each other]

Deputy: [Finally extending his arm, inviting the gang in] Have fun.

Marshall: [to a boy on horseback next to him whom we didn't notice before] That's how you handle 'em, son, never give 'em an inch. Maintain discipline at all times. Remember that word...discipline.

Strickland's Son: [Solemnly] I will, Pa.

[Scene: At the dance, near the banquet table. Marty is eating off a pie plate when Seamus and Maggie McFly run into him]

Seamus: Why, Mr. Eastwood. Nice to see ya. I see you got yourself some respectable clothes, lad. And a fine hat.

Marty: Yeah, well, a couple other people didn't like the way the other one looked on me.

Maggie: Sure'n that one suits you Mr. Eastwood. Very becomin'.

Marty: Ahh...thanks. [He has finished the pie and checks out the writing on the bottom of the plate] Hey...Frisbee. Far out. [He grins and exits]

[There is a pause, and then Seamus turns to Maggie]

Seamus: What was the meanin' of that?

Maggie: It was right in front of him.

Seamus: Aye.

[Scene: The dance. Doc and Clara and the other couples are shown dancing]

[Scene: Below Doc and Clara's dance floor. The gang and Tannen are checking things out, trying to find "that cheatin' blacksmith."]

Gang Member: There he is, Buford.

Buford: [A growling sound is heard instead of a normal questioning voice] Where?

Gang Member: Right there. [Points upward towards Doc and Clara] Dancin' with that piece a calico.

Gang Member #2: What are ya gonna do, boss?

Buford: [His voice growing dark] I figure...I'll bury this muzzle deep enough in his back, nobody'll hear the shot.

Gang Member: Careful, Buford, you only got one bullet with that.

Buford: I only need one.

[Scene: Doc and Clara dancing]

[Doc looks absolutely enchanted with Clara and is goggling over her while they dance. Suddenly when they dance themselves into a corner, Doc feels a gun barrel in his back and freezes with terror on his face, Clara still in front of him]

Buford: I told you to watch your back, Smithy.

Doc: [Trying to maintain composure] Tannen. But you're early. [Obviously he hadn't considered the possible factor that he wasn't killed right away after the shot]

Buford: It's a Derringer, Smithy. Small but effective. Last time I used it, fella took two whole days to die. Bled to death inside, it was real painful. [Gang laughs] That means you'd be dead by about suppertime Monday.

Clara: [Interrupting] I don't know who you think you are, but we're dancing.

Buford: [Notices Clara seemingly for the first time] Well, looky what we have here...introduce me to the lady; I'd like a dance.

Doc: [Turning around to face Tannen with a brave and determined look on his face. Now Buford moves the gun barrel to his throat] I wouldn't give you the pleasure; you'll just have to go ahead and shoot.

Buford: Alright.

Clara: [Sensing very obvious danger] No, Emmett. I'll dance with him! I'll dance with him!

Buford: Boys, keep the blacksmith company while I get acquainted with the filly. [He pushes Doc aside and his gang members take ahold of each of his arms. Doc has a very restrained and angered look on his face as Buford begins dancing with Clara, much like Marty's reaction in Back to the Future 1 when Biff has his way with Lorraine in the car at the dance] WOO...HA HA! YEAH. OOOH.

Clara: I don't dance very well when my partner has a gun in his hand.

Buford: [Holding her very close and very disgustingly] Well, you'll learn. [In a louder voice] You know, Smithy, I may just take my $80 worth outta her! [Doc struggles to be let go to save his beloved Clara] WOO...HAHAHA! YEAH. [to Clara] I bet there's somethin' you can do that's worth $80.

Clara: I'm afraid you've underestimated me, Mister.

Buford: [Very gullibly] Have I now?

[In response, Clara kicks Buford very hard in the shins. Buford cringes over in pain and Clara backs out. Doc finally frees himself. The music stops]

Doc: Stop it! Damn you, Tannen!

Buford: No, I damn you. [He draws his gun and aims at Doc. Marty, from the banquet table (the little pig) finally sees what's going on and his eyes open wide. He grabs the Frisbee plate] I damn you to hell!

[At the same moment Buford fires his single bullet, Marty tosses the plate. Miraculously, it blocks the bullet from harming Doc and the only thing that happens to him is he is shown stunned that he is alive and his hat blows off his head. Buford instantaneously turns to see who stopped his victory]

Buford: You!

Marty II: [Stepping down from the banquet table, through the crowd and toward Tannen] Hey, lighten up, jerk!

[Buford turns to his gang members, who shrug in response. What the heck does that mean?]

Buford: Mighty strong words, runt! You man enough to back 'em up with more than just a pie plate?!

Marty II: [Backing down a little] Look, just leave my friends alone. [He starts walking away]

Buford: What's wrong, dude, you yella? [Marty pauses in mid-step and turns slowly to face Tannen] That's what I thought. Yella belly.

[Marty moves back to his original stance, pointing his forefinger at Buford]

Marty II: Nobody... calls me yellow.

Buford: Let's finish it...right now.

Gang Member #1: Uh, not now, Buford...uh…Marshall's got our guns.

Buford: [Undaunted] Well, like I said, we'll finish this tomorrow.

Gang Member #2: Tomorrow we're robbin' the Pine City Stage.

[Buford turns in exasperation to his gang behind him]

Buford: How 'bout Monday? We doin' anything Monday?

[Gang members look at each other and shake their heads]

Gang Member #3: No, Monday'd be fine... you can kill him on Monday.

Buford: [Quickly turning to face Marty] I'll be back this way on Monday. We'll settle this then. [He points a finger towards the dirt road] Right there out in the street, in front of the Palace Saloon.

Marty II: [A little uncomfortably] Yeah, right, well, when? Sarcastically. High noon?

Buford: Noon? I do my killin' before breakfast. Seven o'clock!

Marty II: [Obviously is very uncomfortable with this situation. He clears his throat] Eight o'clock. [Again, gaining confidence] I do my killin' after breakfast.

[Doc finally whispers to Marty in a concerned voice]

Doc: Marty...no. [Clara looks at him then and he casually changes his expression to smiling and stops talking to Marty]

[Seamus and Maggie are watching all of this. Maggie's brought young William and he suddenly begins to cry in her arms]

[There is a long silence. Suddenly Strickland comes on stage with his rifle]

Strickland: Alright now, break it up. What's all this about...you causin' trouble here, Tannen?

Buford: No trouble, Marshall. Just a little personal matter between me and Eastwood. [Marty looks away in exasperation. He obviously thinks this is a little retarded] This don't concern the law.

Strickland: [Without hesitation] Tonight, everything concerns the law - now break it up. Any brawlin', it's fifteen days in the county jail. [He lowers his gun and changes his tone to address the crowd] Come on, this is a party! Come on, let's have some fun!

[The music resumes. People begin dancing again. Buford approaches Marty on the sidelines.]

Buford: 8:00 Monday, runt. You ain't here, I'll hunt you and shoot you down like a duck.

Gang Member #1: It's dog, Buford. Shoot 'im down like a dog.

[Buford is obviously upset that his tough-guy image has been shattered by his stupidity] Let's go, boys! Let these sissies have their party!

[The gang exits, and Doc pulls Marty aside (Clara is currently offscreen)]

Doc: Marty, what are you doing, saying you're gonna meet Tannen??

Marty II: Doc, don't worry about it! Monday morning, 8 AM. We're gonna be gone, right?

Doc: Theoretically, yes, but what if the train's late??

[Marty obviously has not thought of this before and is taken aback] Late??

[Clara returns from wherever she went and is instantly by Doc's side]

Doc: We'll discuss this later.

Marty II: No, we'll discuss this now...late?

Clara: Thank you for your gallantry, Mr. Eastwood.

[Marty loves the attention and tries to be modest] No, hey, ma'am.

Clara: Had you not interceded, Emmett might have been shot!

Doc: Marty...uh, Clint...I'm gonna take Clara home.

[Before Marty has a chance to respond he is pulled away by a man at the party]

Man: You sure set him straight, Mr. Eastwood. I'm glad somebody finally got the gumption to stand up to that son-of-a-bitch.

Man #2: You're alright in my book, Mr. Eastwood...I'd like to buy you a drink.

[Marty is not accustomed to all this attention, and he faces both men] Hey, look, I don't want a drink. [It was no big deal. He starts to move in closer, obviously, to begin describing what he did, but there is a tap on his back. It's the Colt Gun Salesman, holding out a Colt Peacemaker and a gun-belt]

Colt Gun Salesman: Young man, young man...I'd like you to have this brand new Colt Peacemaker and gun belt, free of charge!

[Marty takes the gun and belt] Free?

Colt Gun Salesman: I want ever'body to know that the gun that shot Buford Tannen was a Colt Peacemaker. [He accentuates the words "Colt Peacemaker" to make them sound magnificent]

Marty II: Hey, hey, thanks. [Studying the gun and belt]

Colt Gun Salesman: Of course, you understand that if you lose...I'm takin' it back. [He smiles and walks away]

Marty II: [stares between the gun and the salesman moving into the distance for a moment before thinking of something to say] Thanks again.

[Marty walks in the opposite direction the salesman headed and heads right into Seamus and Maggie McFly (no bumping of course, just an opportunity for them to talk). They continue walking together]

Seamus: You had 'im, Mr. Eastwood! You could have just walked away, and nobody woulda thought the lessa ya for it. All it would have been was words... hot air from a buffoon. [Marty looks away with an obvious air of "I-don't-need-this"] Instead, you let him rile ya...rile ya into playin' his game, his way, by his rules.

Marty II: Seamus, relax, I know what I'm doin'.

Maggie: He reminds me of poor Martin.

Seamus: Aye.

Marty II: Who?

Seamus: Me brother.

[Marty is obviously stunned. Somebody else shared his name in the family?] Wait a minute...you have a brother named Martin McFly? [They stop walking]

Seamus: Had a brother. [His voice takes on an explaining air and Marty resumes the "I-don't-need-this" expression] Martin used to let men provoke him into fightin'. He was concerned people would tink him a coward if he refused. That's how he got a bowie knife shoved through his belly in a saloon in Virginia City. Never considered the future, poor Martin, God rest his soul.

[Seamus walks away. Maggie stays with Marty for a moment]

Maggie: Sure hopin' you're considerin' the future, Mr. Eastwood. [She and William, whom she is holding in her arms, follow Seamus]

[Marty looks after them] I think about it all the time.

[Scene: An open field at night. Doc and Clara are seated on their horses, very close, watching the stars through a telescope. We see their backs first and the cameras close in on them. The one-room schoolhouse is in the distance]

Clara: And that crater in the middle northwest, out there all by itself like a starburst?

Doc: Uh-huh.

Clara: That one's called Copernicus. [She laughs] Listen to me, I feel like I'm teaching school!

Doc: Oh, please, continue your lesson. [He laughs] I never found lunar geography so fascinating. You're quite knowledgeable.

Clara: When I was 11, I had diphtheria. I was quarantined for three months, so my father bought me this telescope and put it next to my bed so I could see everything out my window. [She pauses for a moment, looking up at the stars] Emmett, do you think we'll ever be able to travel to the moon, like we travel across the country on trains?

[Doc smiles and answers with assuredness] Definitely, although not for another 84 years and not on trains. We'll have space vehicles... capsules to sail off in rockets - devices that create giant explosions...explosions that are so...powerful that they...

[Clara finishes his sentence quite calmly] ...they break the pull of the earth's gravity and send their projectile through outer space. [Doc looks at her in wonder. Clara just laughs] Emmett...I read that book too! You're quoting Jules Verne, From the Earth to the Moon.

Doc: [In obvious quiet excitement] You've read Jules Verne?

Clara: I adore Jules Verne.

Doc: So do I. 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, my absolute favorite. The first time I read that when I was a little boy, I wanted to meet Captain Nemo and...

Clara: [laughing] Please, Emmett...you couldn't have read that when you were a little boy, it was only first published ten years ago.

Doc: [Pretends to look confused] Oh, yes, well...I meant it made me feel like a boy. [He pauses and sees that this is a satisfactory answer] I never met a woman who liked Jules Verne before.

Clara: I never ever...met a man like you before.

[They lean in and kiss. The cameras back out again and the scene closes with pretty "starry" music]

[Scene: Morning at the blacksmith shop]

[This scene is reminiscent of the one at the beginning of BTTF 1, with Doc's crazy inventions and obsession with clocks...1800's style. Eggs and bacon come out and start cooking at scheduled times and Marty wakes up. He climbs out of his little cot and faces away from the camera. He is wearing a white pajama suit. He may not notice, but a part of his bare ass is exposed and is out there for the world to see]

Marty II: Doc! Doc! [He doesn't see Doc anywhere and speaks to himself] I hope you know what you're doin'. [his eye falls on the Colt Peacemaker and its belt. He picks up the gun and faces the mirror] You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me, Tannen? [Pausing] Well I'm the only one here. Go ahead...make my day!

[Scene: Downtown Hill Valley]

Man #1: Hey, good morning, Mr. Eastwood!

Marty II: Morning.

Man #2: Have a cigar, Mr. Eastwood. Anything I can do for you today, Mr. Eastwood?

Marty II: No, no, it's... fine.

[Man #3 is riding by in a carriage with his family] Good luck tomorrow, Mr. Eastwood! We'll be prayin' for ya!

Marty II: [Calling back] Thanks.

[The Undertaker has a striking resemblance to the scary-looking member of Limp Bizkit who plays guitar (not Fred Durst)] Good morning, Mr. Eastwood. Interest you in a new suit for a tomorrow?

Marty II: Ah, I'm...I'm fine. Thanks.

[He sees Doc about fifty yards away, sniffing a lavender flower pin stuck to his jacket. He approaches him]

Marty II: Doc. What are you doin'?

Doc: [Stops sniffing] Oh, nothing...just out enjoying the morning air. It's really lovely here in the morning, don't you think?

Marty II: Yeah, it's lovely Doc. Listen, we gotta load the DeLorean; we gotta get ready to roll, alright? Hey look at that, the tombstone. [He suddenly spots freshly carved tombstones in front of a shop waiting to be engraved]

Doc: Marty, let me see that photograph again. [Marty hands it to him and Doc looks at it, walking toward the camera with his back to the actual tombstones. He sighs] My name...it's vanished.

Marty II: Hey, that's great Doc! Don't you get it - we're goin' back to the future tomorrow, so everything's bein' erased!

Doc: But only my name is erased! The tombstone itself and the date still remain. That doesn't make sense. We know that this photograph represents what will happen if the events of today continue to run their course into tomorrow.

Marty II: Right, and so?

Undertaker: [Comes on suddenly and pulls a measuring tape from Marty's shoulder to his feet] Excuse me, Mr. Eastwood, I just need to take your measurement.

Marty II: Hey, look, pal, I don't wanna buy a suit!

Undertaker: [Laughs] No, this is for your coffin.

Marty II: My coffin?!

Undertaker: Well, the odds are running two to one against you. [He pulls the measuring tape back to its original position and makes a choking motion with his hand against his own throat] Might as well be prepared. [He exits]

Doc: So...it may not be my name that's supposed to end up on that tombstone. It may...be...yours.

[Marty continues walking away from the tombstone and then stops, with his hand to his forehead] Great Scott!

[Doc assumes a position behind Marty's shoulder; for the first time in the trilogy, Marty and Doc say each other's lines] I know, this is heavy. [Marty and Doc start walking in the original direction Marty had been in at the beginning of the scene] Marty, why are wearing that gun? You're not considering going up against Tannen tomorrow?!?

Marty II: Doc, tomorrow morning I'm goin' back to the future with you. But if Buford Tannen comes lookin' for trouble, I'm gonna be ready for him. You heard what that son-of-a-bitch called me last night.

Doc: Marty, you can't go losing your judgment every time someone calls you a name! That's exactly what causes you to get into that accident in the future.

Marty II: [Suddenly stops in his tracks and turns] What? What about my future?

[Doc's expression changes to one of sad, final acceptance] I can't tell you. It might make things worse.

Marty II: Wait a minute, Doc...what is wrong with my future?!

Doc: [Calmly] Marty...we all have to make decisions that affect the course of our lives. You've gotta do what you've gotta do. And I've gotta do what I've gotta do.

[Doc exits Marty pauses for a moment, staring into space before following him]

[Scene: Near the railroad tracks at night. Marty is stooped down repairing something on a bump in the tracks when Doc appears and stoops down to talk]

Doc: Marty.

Marty II: Yeah?

Doc: I've made a decision. I'm not going with you tomorrow. I'm staying here.

Marty II: [Slowly, then defiantly] What are you talkin' about, Doc?!

Doc: There's no point in denying it. I'm in love with Clara.

Marty II: Oh man. Doc, we don't belong here! Neither one of us! You know it could still be you that gets shot tomorrow! [He puffs his chest out and points at it, then takes out the photograph of the tombstone from his pocket and stuffs it in Doc's face] This tombstone could still be in your future!

Doc: Marty...the future isn't written. It can be changed; you know that! Anyone can make their future whatever they want it to be. I can't let this one little photograph determine my entire destiny. I have to live my life according to what I believe is right... in my heart.

Marty II: [Sighing] Doc...you're a scientist. So you tell me. What's the right thing to do, up here?? [He points to his own forehead]

Doc: [sighs and pauses] You're right, Marty.

[They pull a switch and the DeLorean rolls slowly down the tracks. Marty and Doc stare after it]

Marty II: Wow, that worked great.

Doc: I've at least gotta tell her goodbye.

Marty: C'mon...Doc...I mean, think about it...what are you gonna say to her, "I gotta go back to the future”?? I mean, she's not gonna understand that, Doc. Hell, I’m in it with ya and I don't even understand it. [He pauses as Doc sighs] Doc. Listen. Maybe we could...I dunno, maybe we could just take Clara with us.

Doc: To the future? [He pauses] You've reminded me, Marty, I'm a scientist so I must be scientific about this. I cautioned you about disruption of the continuum for your own personal benefit; therefore I must do no less. We will proceed as planned, and as soon as we return to 1985 we'll destroy this infernal machine. Traveling through time has become much too painful.

[Doc exits and Marty stares after him before following him]

[Scene: Outdoors by a campfire. Marty and Doc are warming themselves in front of the fire, Marty soundly asleep on the ground. Doc gets up]

[Scene: Clara's house; there is a knock at the door]

Doc: It's Emmett, Clara.

[Clara is writing at a desk. She gets up and opens the door, smiling when she sees Doc]

Clara: Oh, Emmett, won't you come in?

Doc: No...I better not. I...

Clara: What's wrong?

Doc: I've come to say goodbye.

Clara: Goodbye? Well, where ya goin'?

Doc: I'm going away...and I'm afraid I'll never see you again.

Clara: Emmett...

Doc: Clara...I want you to know that I care about you deeply, but I realize that I don't belong here, and I have to go back to where I came from.

Clara: And where might that be?

Doc: ...I can't tell you.

Clara: Well, wherever you're going, take me with you!

Doc: I can't, Clara. I wish it didn't have to be this way...but just believe me when I say that I'll never forget you and that...I love you.

Clara: I don't understand what you're trying to say.

Doc: Clara...I don't think there's any way that you can understand it.

Clara: Please, Emmett, please...I have to know. If you sincerely do love me...then tell me the truth.

Doc: All right then. I'm from the future. [Clara looks at him in disbelief] I came here in a time machine that I invented and tomorrow I have to go back to the year 1985.

Clara: [Clara's face changes to a look of certainty] Yes, Emmett, I do understand. [Doc looks relieved, but Clara slowly clenches her teeth and menacingly steps toward him] I understand that because you know I'm partial to the writings of Jules Verne you concocted those mendacities in order to take advantage of me! [She slaps Doc on the cheek] Oh, I've heard some whoppers in my day but the fact that you'd expect me to entertain a notion like that is so...insulting and degrading! [She turns back toward her door] All you had to say is "I don't love you and I don't wanna see you anymore." That at least would've been respectful! [She slams the door]

Doc: [Staring after her] But that's not the truth!

[There is a pause. Doc, in a heartbreakingly emotional way, removes the flower from his suit that Clara has given him and leaves it on the windowsill next to her doorway. He exits, and we notice through the window a bedroom. Clara runs into the room and buries her face on the bed, crying]

[Scene: The saloon at night]

Chester: Emmett! What can I get you, the usual?

Doc: No, Chester, I'm gonna need something a lot stronger than that tonight.

Bartender: [Certainty in his voice] Sarsaparilla.

Doc: Whiskey, Chester.

[Chester stares at him in wonder]

Whiskey...Emmett, are you sure? You know what happened to you on the fourth of July...

Doc: Whiskey.

Chester: [Taking out the bottle] Okay, I ain't ya papa. [He pours some in a small shot glass] I just don't wanna see ya...do the wrong thing.

[Doc stops Chester from moving to put the bottle back] You can leave the bottle.

A bearded, spectacled man whom we previously had not noticed slides down the bar and begins speaking to Doc.

Barbwire Salesman: It's a woman, right? I knew it! I have seen that look on a man's face a thousand times, all across the country. Well I can tell you, friend. You'll get over her.

Doc: Oh-ho. Clara was one in a million. One in a billion. One in a googolplex. The woman of my dreams and I lost her for all time.

Barbwire Salesman: I can assure you, sir, there are other women. If by peddling this barbed wire all across the country has taught me one thing for certain, it's that you never know what the future might bring.

Doc: Oh-ho...the future, I can tell you about the future.

[Scene: Dawn at the campfire. Marty is just waking up, lifting his head from the barrel of his gun which he slept on top of the entire night]

Marty II: Oh...oh, man, did I sleep...what time is it, Doc? [He notices Doc isn't there] Doc!

[He looks at the photo of the tombstone. Underneath the text "Here lies..." very faintly the words "Clint Eastwood" are beginning to appear. He looks up and sees Doc's horse is gone]

[Scene: Dawn at another campfire with Tannen and his gang, who have also been sleeping. Buford, however, is more than awake]

Buford: Wake up! [He kicks one of his gang members in the stomach, forcing him to cringe and try to get up] I got me a runt to kill! [He does it again to another member]

Gang Member #1: It's still early, boss.

Gang Member #2: It's still early!

Buford: I'm hungry.

[Scene: Saloon. Doc is holding his shot glass and talking to the entire saloon in a slow, distant voice]

Doc: ...but in the future, we don't need horses. We have motorized carriages called auto-mo-biles.

[Jeb Chuckles]

Old Timer (Jeb): If everybody's got one of these auto-whatsits, does anybody walk or run anymore?

Doc: Of course we run. But for recreation, for fun.

Old Timer (Jeb): Run for fun? Ha-ha, what the hell kinda fun is that?

[Another Old Timer laughs hysterically]

[Scene: Town. Marty jumps off his horse, running into the blacksmith shop]

Marty II: Doc! Doc!

[Marty comes out of the blacksmith shop and looks around. He sees the saloon]

[Scene: Saloon]

Old Timer (Levi): How much has he had?

Chester: None. That's his first one and he hasn't touched it, yet. He just likes to hold it.

[Levi laughs. Marty bursts into the saloon, running towards Doc]

Marty II: Doc! Doc! [He sees the glass] What're you doin'?

Doc: I lost her, Marty. There's nothing left for me here.

Marty II: All right, so that's why you've gotta come back with me.

Doc [looks confused] Where?

Marty II [in a what's-wrong-with-you voice]: Back to the future!

Doc [with a sudden conviction]: Right. Let's get going. [He puts down his glass]

Marty II: Great.

Doc: Gentlemen, excuse me, but my friend and I have to catch a train.

Old Timer #2 (Zeke): Here's to ya, blacksmith. [He raises his glass in salute]

Old Timer #3 (Jeb): And to the future! [He raises his glass as well]

Old Timer #1 (Levi): Amen.

Doc: Amen. [He raises his glass from the bar and puts his mouth to it]

Chester: Emmett, no!!

[He's too late; Doc has already swallowed the whiskey. As Marty and Chester watch in horror, Doc takes one step forward and keels over, knocking over the Old Timers' table and their breakfasts]

Marty II: Doc! Doc! Doc! C'mon, Doc, wake up, wake up, Doc. [to Chester] How many did he have?

Chester: Just the one.

Marty II: [in disbelief] Just the one?! C'mon, Doc.

Chester: Now, there's a feller that can't hold his liquor.

Marty II: Gimme some coffee... black.

Chester: Joey, coffee!

[Marty looks out the window and sees the clock. It reads 7:45]

[Scene: A road]

Gang: Giddy up, hey, hoot!

[Tannen's gang gallops on their horses towards town]

[Scene: Ticket office at the train station]

Clerk: Ma'am.

Clara: How far does the 8:00 train go?

Clerk: San Francisco's the end of the line.

Clara: I'll take a one-way ticket.

[Scene: Saloon. Marty is trying to feed Doc the coffee, and nothing is working]

Chester: You wanna sober him up in a hurry, son, you're gonna have to use somethin' a lot stronger than coffee.

Marty II: Yeah, what do you suggest?

Chester: Joey. Let's make some wake up juice.

[Joey sets out a variety of ingredients. Chester pours the mixture with the help of Joey]

Chester: In about ten minutes, he's gonna be as sober as a priest on Sunday.

Marty II: Ten minutes?! [Looks at clock, sees it is now 7:50] Why do we have to cut these things so damn close?

[Chester walks over with the glass of liquid, a funnel and a clothespin] Here, stick this clothespin on his nose, and when he opens up his mouth, go ahead and pour it on down his gullet. [Marty begins to comply] Oh and stand back.

[Marty pours the liquid through the funnel and for a moment, nothing happens. Luckily, he stands up just in time, because Doc's eyes suddenly open wide, he jumps up and shrieks...]

Doc: WAHHHH!! HOT! HOT!

[He runs out of the saloon holding his throat and turns, dunking his head straight into the water- filled horse trough. He doesn't move]

[Marty and Chester run out after him and look around, and spot him by the horse trough. They lift him out of the water and look at his face]

Marty II: He's still out!

[Chester, as they bring Doc back into the saloon] Oh, that? That was just a reflex action. It's gonna take a few more minutes for the stuff to really clear up his head.

Marty II: Perfect.

[Scene: Hill Valley train station. Clara boards the train, apparently signaling that Marty and Doc are late]

[Scene: Saloon. Seamus McFly enters as Marty and Chester are slapping Doc's (who is sitting in a chair, unconscious) face, trying to get him to wake up]

Marty II: C'mon, Doc, c'mon...wake up, buddy. C'mon, wake up, Doc, c'mon, c'mon.

Chester: Seamus. Wouldn't expect to see you here this mornin'.

Seamus: Aye. But somethin' inside me told me I should be here. As if my future had somethin' to do with it. [Walks away]

[Marty turns for a moment and stares at Seamus. Then Chester speaks, snapping him back into helping-Doc mode]

Chester: He'll come around in a minute.

Marty II: C'mon, Doc, c'mon...wake up, now, buddy, c'mon.

Buford [offscreen]: Are you in there, Eastwood? [Marty looks up out the window which is on the other side of the room. Buford is outside, yelling into the saloon] It's eight o'clock, and I'm callin' you out.

Marty II: [stepping towards Buford cautiously, yelling through the closed window]: It's not 8:00 yet!

Buford: It is by my watch! Let's settle this once and for all, runt. Or ain't you got the gumption?

[Marty takes the photo of the tombstone from his pocket and sees that the photograph now clearly reads "Here lies Clint Eastwood." He is shocked. Slowly, he gulps]

Marty II: Listen. I'm not really feelin' up to this today. So I'm gonna have to forfeit!

Buford: Forfeit? Forfeit! [He turns to one of his gang members] What's that mean?

Gang Member: Uh...it means that you win without a fight.

Buford: Without shootin'? Hey, he can't do that. [He starts yelling at Marty again] You can't do that! [Marty gulps again] You know what I think? I think you ain't nothin' but a gutless yella turd. And I'm givin' ya to the count of 10 to come out here and prove I'm wrong. 1...

Marty II: [quickly turns back to Doc] Doc!! C'mon, sober up, buddy, let's go.

Buford: 2...

Old Timer #2 (Zeke): You better get out there son - I got $20 gold bet on ya so don't let me down.

Old Timer #1 (Levi): I got $30 gold bet again’ ya so don't let ME down.

Buford: 3...4...

Old Timer #3 (Jeb): You better face up to it son, 'cause if you don't go out there...

Buford: 5...

Marty II: What? What if I don't go out there?

Old Timer (Levi): You're a coward!

Buford: 6...

Toothless: And you'll be branded a coward for the rest of your days!

Old Timer #3 (Jeb): Ever'body, everwhere, will say Clint Eastwood is the biggest yella belly in the west.

[Buford looks at his gang members. One of them holds up seven fingers for him]

Buford: 7...

Man: Here...[He slides a gun across the table]

Buford: 8...

Marty II: I already got a gun. [He passes it back to the man]

Buford: 9...

[Marty stares wide-eyed at everyone around him and each and every one of them returns the wide-eyed, silent gaze]

Buford: 10! You hear me, runt? I said that's ten, you gutless yella pie slinger.

Marty II [shrugs suddenly] He's an asshole! [Seamus nods as if to say, "you tell him!"] I don't care what Tannen says! And I don't care what anybody else says either.

[Just then Doc jumps up]

Doc: Whoa!

Marty II: Doc, Doc, you okay??!!

Doc: I think so...whoa, what a headache!

Marty II [to Chester]: Listen, you got a back door to this place?

Chester: Yeah, it's in the back.

Marty II: C'mon, Doc, let's go. [They start heading out]

Buford: Are you comin' out here, runt, or do I have to go in there after ya?

[Marty and Doc escape out a back door and start climbing down some stairs in an alleyway]

Doc: The thing I really miss here is Tylenol.

[A gang member turns and spots them]

Gang Member: Hey! [Marty instantly jumps away] Freeze, blacksmith!

[Scene: Train. The whistle blows. The train is finally leaving the station. The Barbwire Salesman from last night is sitting next to another man directly behind Clara, who is sitting alone]

Barbwire Salesman: Yessir, that poor fella last night had the biggest case of broken heart I have ever seen! And when he said that he didn't know how he could live the rest of his life knowing how much hurt he'd caused that little girl? Well, I really felt for him. I did. Right here.

[Scene: The back of the saloon. Marty is alone. He watches out the window as Tannen and his gang members hold Doc]

Buford: Listen up, Eastwood! I intend to shoot somebody today and I prefer'd it be you. But if you're just too damn yella, I guess it'll just have to be your blacksmith friend.

Doc: Forget about me, Marty, and save yourself!

Buford: You got one minute to decide. You hear me runt? One minute!

[Marty turns from the window]

[Scene: On the train]

Barbwire Salesman: I never seen a man so broken up over a woman. What'd you say her name was? Cara? Sara?

Barbwire Salesman’s Companion: Clara?

Barbwire Salesman: Clara!

[Clara instantly spins around]

Clara: Excuse me.

Barbwire Salesman: Ma'am?

Clara: But was this man tall, with great big brown puppy dog eyes and long silvery flowing hair??

Barbwire Salesman: You know him?

Clara: [Spins around] Emmett!

[She pulls on a string, bringing the train instantly to a halt. Everyone almost topples out of their seats]

[Scene: Outside saloon. Marty is not there; Buford and his gang (with Doc) are]

Buford: Time's up, runt! [He throws the watch at Doc and points his gun toward him] Prepare to meet your Maker, blacksmith.

Marty II [offscreen]: Right here, Tannen!

[Buford turns. They assume positions seen in normal shooting scenes in Westerns. A crowd gathers - everyone who was in the saloon comes out and so do all the townspeople nearby]

Buford: Draw!

Marty II: No! [Buford stares at him. He throws his gun and belt down, gulping] I thought we could settle this like men.

Buford: [After a pause] You thought wrong, dude. [He shoots and Marty falls to the ground]

[Buford laughs and walks toward the fallen "Eastwood"]

[Doc looks at Buford and then turns to see Marty on the ground, turning back and forth in disbelief]

Buford: Ahh, thank ya.

[Buford stops in front of Marty, pointing his gun at him to finish him off. Suddenly Marty's foot flies up and knocks the gun out of Buford's hand. He stands up to Buford's shock, lifting his shirt to reveal a nineteenth century stove cover that he had put under it as a bullet-proof vest (he got the idea from A Fistful of Dollars that Biff was watching in 1985A). Buford throws a punch and nearly breaks his hand because it is so hard. Marty takes the stove cover off and hits Buford with it. He falls, but then stands up again. Marty punches him again and again, and Buford crashes into a tombstone in front of a shop, breaking it in half, and then lands headfirst in the A. Jones Manure Cart. Everyone stares]

Seamus: [Chuckles slightly] That was good.

[The deputy Marshall and his officers are galloping on horseback toward the scene]

Gang Member: You know what I think? I think Buford's goin' to jail.

Gang Member #2: You're right.

[All of the gang members take off, but Doc stops them. They just let go of Doc and run away]

Deputy Marshall: Get him out of that shit. Get 'em! [He indicates the escaping criminals, and his officers gallop away in pursuit. He points his long rifle at Buford's head]

Deputy Marshall: Buford Tannen, you're under arrest for robbin' the Pine City Stage. You got anything to say?

[Buford slowly spits out two mouthfuls of manure] I hate manure.

Doc: Look! [He indicates the split tombstone and Marty immediately whips out the photo, from which the image of the tombstone vanishes]

Marty II: YES!

[The train whistle blows]

Doc: The train!

Marty II: Can we make it?

Doc: We'll have to cut 'em off at Coyote Pass!

[They quickly get on their horses but before they leave a little boy stops Marty]

Little Boy: Hey Mister...Mr. Eastwood. Here's your gun, Mister. [The little boy gives the gun to Marty]

Marty II: Thanks, kid. [He spots his great-great-grandfather standing in front of the saloon. Seamus grins and rolls his hands into fists, faking a punch to show that he saw what Marty did] Seamus! [Marty throws the gun and the belt at him] Worth $12, never been used.

Seamus: Maybe I'll trade it for a new hat.

Marty II: Right, and take care of that baby! [He rides off with Doc toward the train]

Seamus [calls after him]: I will!

[Scene: Blacksmith shop]

[Clara bursts in, shouting]

Clara: Emmett! Emmett! Emmett! [She stops and studies the model of the railroad. She picks up the wooden futuristic automobile and reads the words printed on it] ...Time machine...

[Scene: Outside the moving train somewhere in the countryside outside Hill Valley]

Doc: C'mon Marty!

Marty II: Ah! Ah!

Doc: Ah, gimme your hand!

Marty II: Ahhh! Whoa! Whoa! Ahh!

[Scene: Somewhere, Clara is on her horse following the train]

[Scene: Moving train]

[As they jump the trains Doc and Marty make very peculiar yelling noises]

Doc: Wa-ha!

Marty II: Whoa!

Doc: Hoo! C'mon, Marty!

[Marty jumps on the top of another car, yelling all the way]

Marty II: Ahhhhh!

Doc: C'mon, let's go! Masks on.

[They tie bandanas over their mouths and climb over a train car filled with logs and into the cab]

Doc: Freeze! [He and Marty are holding guns]

Engineer: Is this a holdup? [He holds his hands up]

Doc: [after he and Marty look at each other] It's a science experiment! Stop the train just before ya hit the switch track up ahead.

[Scene: Outside in front of the train, which is a few paces away from the DeLorean which has already been rolled onto the tracks]

Marty II: Doc! [He holds his hand up after throwing the signal switch]

Doc: [pointing a gun at the engineer and his assistant giving them directions] Uncouple the cars from the tender!

[Marty climbs up into the train as it starts to move. Doc blows the train whistle. It makes a "Toot! Toot!" noise]

Doc: I've wanted to do that my whole life!

[Marty laughs]

[Scene: Between the DeLorean and the train. Marty and Doc are grabbing colored logs from the car and carrying them to the train]

Marty II: What are these things, anyway?

Doc: My own version of Presto Logs. Compressed wood with anthracite dust chemically treated to make the fire burn hotter and longer. I use them in my forge to stoke it. These three will light the fire sequentially, making the fire burn hotter, kick up the boiler pressure and make the train go faster.

[Scene: With Clara, who is still following the train. She sees the cars and not the cab and kicks her horse in its side with her foot]

Clara: Hi-yah! [She starts moving again]

[Scene: Inside the DeLorean. Marty is in the car, which is hooked up to the front of the train. Doc is in the front of the train]

[The train whistle blows]

Marty II: [into walkie-talkie] Ready to roll!

[There is a shot of Clara following them. She can see them now, but they cannot see her]

Clara: EMMETT!

Doc: [into walkie-talkie] Marty. are the time circuits on?

Marty II: [into walkie-talkie] Check, Doc.

Doc: [into walkie-talkie] Input the destination time - October 27, 1985, 11 AM.

[Marty punches this information into the keypad]

Marty II: [into walkie-talkie] We're cruising at a steady 25 miles an hour, Doc.

Doc: [into walkie-talkie] I'm throwing in the Presto Logs.

[He throws the logs into the fire, one by one]

Doc: [into walkie-talkie] Marty, the new gauge will show the boiler temperature. [Inside the DeLorean Marty looks at the new device Doc has installed] The color coding indicates when each log will fire. Green, yellow, and red. Each detonation will be accompanied by a sudden burst of acceleration. Hopefully we'll get up to 88 miles per hour before the needle hits much past two thousand.

Marty II: [into walkie-talkie] Why, what happens when it hits two thousand?

[Clara has meanwhile caught up with the end of the train]

Doc: [into walkie-talkie] The whole boiler explodes.

Marty II: [into walkie-talkie] Perfect.

[Clara gets off her horse and climbs onto the end of the train]

Marty II: [into walkie-talkie] Hey, Doc, we just hit 35!

Doc: [into walkie-talkie] Okay, Marty, I'm comin' aboard! [He has begun climbing to the front of the train, where the DeLorean and the locomotive are connected]

Clara: Emmett!

Marty II: [staring at speedometer talking to himself] Come on, come on. [He suddenly screams into the walkie-talkie] You better hold on to somethin', Doc, the yellow log's about to blow!!!

[There is a gigantic explosion and Clara is shown, stunned, as she was thrown back a little on top of the wood in the tender she was climbing on]

Clara: Ahh! [as the wind blows in her face] Golly.

Marty II: [into walkie-talkie] We just passed 40!

Clara: [in the cab of the locomotive] Emmett! Emmett! Emmett!

Marty II: [swings open the gull-wing door and shouts into the walkie-talkie while he openly looks at Doc for the first time] We just passed 45, Doc, go for it! [He looks at the speedometer and mutters] Fifty.

[The train whistle blows. This stuns both Marty and Doc, because they both think no one is on the train but them and Marty knows Doc is no longer in the driver's seat. Doc turns]

Clara: Emmett!

Doc: [nearly screaming with delight] Clara!

Clara: [She shrugs and shouts out the window] I love you.

Marty II: [into walkie-talkie] Doc, Doc! What's happening??

Doc: [into walkie-talkie] It's Clara, she's on the train!

Marty II: Clara! [He sits back down in the DeLorean and speaks to himself] Perfect.

Doc: [into walkie-talkie] She's in the cab. I'm gonna go back for her.

[Just then the DeLorean passes by the windmill]

Marty II: [into walkie-talkie] The windmill! Doc, the windmill! We're goin' past 60; you'll never make it!

Doc: [into walkie-talkie] Then we'll have to take her back with us! Keep calling out the speed! [Doc turns to Clara and shouts to her] Clara, climb out here to me!

Clara: I don't know if I can!

Doc: You can do it! Just don't look down...that's it! [Clara slowly makes her way out of the cab]

Marty II: [into walkie-talkie] Sixty miles an hour, Doc!!

Doc: [to Clara] You're doin' fine! Nice and steady! Come on! Just a little further! [All the while Clara is edging closer and closer to him, climbing on the edge of the train]

Clara: I can't Emmett, I'm scared!

Marty II: [into walkie-talkie] SEVENTY!

Doc: Come on...you're doin' fine...nice and easy...that's it...don't look down...

Marty II: [into walkie-talkie] DOC! THE RED LOG'S ABOUT TO BLOW!!!

Doc: Clara!!

[There is a huge explosion. Clara nearly falls off the train]

Doc: Whoa!!

Clara: Emmett!

Doc: Clara! Hold on!

Clara: I can't! [She screams in desperation; she's hanging upside down with her dress ripping]

[Inside the car, the hoverboard flies by itself into a seat near Marty]

Marty II: [into walkie-talkie] Doc! I'm gonna slip you the hoverboard.

Doc: Marty! Watch out!

[Marty turns around to see, just in time, the "End of Track" sign that indicates that the bridge is not yet finished. He ducks into the car before the sign is blown apart by the car]

Marty II: Ahhh!!!

Clara: AHHH!! AHH! EMMETT, HELP!

Doc: Hold on, Clara! Whoo!

Marty II: [into walkie-talkie] Doc! Catch it!

[Doc nods and Marty sends the hoverboard flying toward him]

Doc: Whoa! [His feet land on the board]

Marty II: [He observes] YES! YES!

Clara: Emmett!

Doc: Hold on!

[Doc picks Clara up just in time; they are together on the hoverboard]

Marty II: YES!

[Marty watches in horror as Doc and Clara, staring into each other's eyes, fly away from the DeLorean. But there is no time to do anything about it; Marty slams the gull-wing door and prepares for temporal displacement. He and the DeLorean disappear and the locomotive, on fire, falls off the edge of the ravine causing an explosion throwing logs from the tender everywhere]

[Scene: 1985 Railroad Tracks]

[The familiar three sonic booms are heard, and the DeLorean pops out of nowhere onto the tracks. Marty, sheepish, waves to everyone who stares at this kid from out of nowhere in Old Western clothes in the middle of the railroad tracks in a weird-looking car]

[Suddenly there is a modern-day train whistle. Marty looks up and stares, mortified, as he sees a huge freight that is about to collide head-on with the DeLorean]

Marty II: Shit! [Just in time, he fumbles to open the door and slides out] AHHH!!!

[He is still in the air when the DeLorean is hit by the train and disintegrates into a million different pieces. The train moves on. Marty goes over to where the car used to be, staring as the time circuit boards flicker one last time before they go dead forever]

Marty II: Well, Doc, it's destroyed. [He lifts his head] Just like you wanted.

[Scene: Outside Marty's house]

[Marty runs past the sign that says Lyon Estates and toward his garage, the door of which is open. He slams down a bottle of car wax that was already on the hood of the car. He hears a voice from behind the car]

Biff: Hey butthead! Get away from-

[Biff gets out from behind]

Marty II: Watch it, Biff!

[Biff's tone instantly changes]

Biff: Marty! I - I didn't mean to scare ya! I didn't recognize you in those clothes!

Marty II: What the hell are you doin'?

Biff: Uh...just puttin' on the second coat now! [He indicates Marty's clothes] You goin' cowboy, huh? [He gives Marty a quick thumbs-up]

[The front door flies open and Dave (still in a suit) comes out]

Dave: C'mon, guys, we'll be late for brunch. [He's looking at his watch]

[The entire family starts coming out, one by one, at random intervals from the house]

Linda: Come on, Dad, they won't hold your reservations all day!

George: Lorraine, have you seen my glasses?

Lorraine: They're in your suede jacket, honey. [She is the first to notice her son] Marty, We thought you went to the lake.

Linda: You wore that to the lake?

Marty II: Thank God you guys are all back to normal.

Dave: Hey Marty, who're you supposed to be, Clint Eastwood?

Marty II: Right. I gotta go get Jennifer. [He gets into his truck]

Biff: I really like that hat, Marty.

Marty II: [As he starts the engine] Thanks, Biff.

[Scene: Outside Jennifer's house. Marty pulls up his truck and climbs out. Jennifer is still sleeping in the swinging bench (from the position he and Doc left her in during Back to the Future Part II)]

Marty II: Jennifer. Jen. Jennifer. Wake up.

[Marty sits beside her on the swing. She hasn't stirred yet. He gently touches her cheek and she croons softly. He bends down and kisses her. Her eyes open and she smiles]

Jennifer: Marty. [She sits up and embraces him, and she changes her expression] I had the worst nightmare.

[Scene: Town]

[Marty and Jennifer are sitting in the truck, waiting for a traffic light. No other cars are around]

Jennifer: Marty, that dream I had was so real. It was about the future. It was about us...and you got fired.

Marty II: What do you mean, I got fired? [He reads the sign outside the car on Jennifer's side. Hilldale. The word registers] Hilldale! This is where we live...I...I mean, this is, uh, this is where we're gonna live. Someday. [He smiles sheepishly]

[Jennifer looks at him very strangely] Marty...it was a dream, wasn't it?

[Before Marty gets a chance to reply, there is a sound of tires screeching and another truck pulls up next to them. It's Needles and his gang. Inside the truck, the song "The Power of Love" by Huey Lewis and the News is booming]

Needles: Hey! The big "M". How's it hangin', McFly?

Marty II: [Without looking at his arch-rival] Hey, Needles.

Needles: [Nodding approvingly of Marty's new truck] Nice set of wheels. Let's see what she can do...next green light.

Marty II: No thanks.

Needles: What's the matter? Chicken?

Jennifer [grabbing Marty's hand] Marty...don't.

Marty II: [He puts the truck in neutral and revs the engine] Grab a hold of somethin'.

[Needles and his gang laugh hysterically and as they get more and more excited as seconds pass; at regular intervals they rev up the engine. Marty looks at them as if they're crazy. The light turns green, and all we see are tires rolling and screeching. Needles speeds on ahead, while Marty spins around and his truck goes in reverse. He and Jennifer stare out the back window at Needles, who is a lone racer]

Jennifer [slightly shocked] Did you do that on purpose?

Marty II: Yeah. You think I was stupid enough to race that asshole?

[Just then, a Rolls Royce appears, apparently wanting to get out of a private street. Needles' truck almost hits it, and he spins around the vehicle just in time]

Marty II: Geez...I woulda hit that Rolls Royce.

[As he stares, puzzled, Jennifer takes out the Cusco FAX she brought home from the future earlier and watches as the text, "YOU'RE FIRED!!!", vanishes from the page]

Jennifer: [In an awed whisper] Erased.

[Scene: At the wreckage site of the DeLorean. No one is there but Marty and Jennifer]

Jennifer: You're right. There's not much left.

Marty II: Doc's never comin' back. I'm sure gonna miss him, Jen. [He picks up a torn piece of paper from the mess. It's a picture, torn in half, of Doc at the clock tower in 1885, probably the one he took from 1955. The other half is missing...was it all just a dream?]

[Suddenly the rail crossing bells start ringing but there is no train in either direction. Jennifer and Marty turn from one direction to the other, puzzled]

Marty II: What the hell?

[Suddenly there is a huge "boom" and Marty and Jennifer are thrown back ten feet and they land in the grass. A shiny train, with "ELB" written on the side, appears. Out of the cab window, Doc pops his head out. He is wearing a tuxedo-ish outfit with a top hat, his hair combed now]

Marty II: Doc!

Doc: Marty!

Marty II: [Excitedly] Doc! Doc!

Doc: Marty! It runs on steam! [He opens the doors of the train and he and Clara stand in the "doorway"] Meet the family. Clara, you know. [Clara appears next to him]

Clara: Hi, Marty!

Marty II: Ma'am!

Doc: These are our boys! [Two young boys step into sight. One looks about ten, the other six or seven] Jules…and Verne! Boys, this is Marty and Jennifer.

Marty II: Doc, I thought I'd never see you again!

Doc: Can't keep a good scientist down. After all, I had to come back for Einstein, and I didn't want you to be worried about me. [Clara hands him something wrapped in brown paper] Oh. I brought you a little souvenir.

[Doc stoops down from the train but doesn't get off and gives the gift to Marty. Marty rips it open. Inside is a framed photo of him and Doc at the clock tower in 1885]

Marty II: It's great Doc. Thanks!

[Marty and Jennifer are surprised at the Brown family's appearance]

Jennifer: Doctor Brown? [She takes out the Cusco FAX from her pocket, holding out for Doc to see] I brought this note back from the future and...now it's erased!

Doc: Of course it's erased!

[Jennifer looks puzzled]

Jennifer: But what does that mean?

Doc: It means that your future hasn't been written yet. No one's has. Your future is whatever you make it. So make it a good one. Both of ya!

Marty II: [Firmly, waving] We will, Doc!

Doc: Stand back! [As the doors close] All right, boys, buckle up!

Marty II: Hey, Doc...where ya goin' now? Back to the future?

Doc: From the cab window, he shakes his head. Nope. Already been there! [He waves at the two teenagers below]

[Marty and Jennifer wave back, and this time the train rises into the air and suddenly gains speed and disappears. The screen blackens and we see...]

THE END
