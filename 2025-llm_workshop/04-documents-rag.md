# 04. Documents and RAG in Open WebUI


## What is RAG



## Passing a document to provide context

Create a new chat with a model like gemma3:4b or qwen3:8b.  

Ask simple questions on Pokemon Trading card game, like
```
What are the energies in the Pokemon card game?

What is a Sudden Death in the Pokemon card game?
```

As you can see, the model knows how to play Pokemon.

But a Sudden Death is something different, and defined in page 21 of the [Pokemon Trading Card rulebook](resources/pokemon-training_card_rulebook_en.pdf).


In the prompt, upload the [Pokemon Trading Card rulebook](resources/pokemon-training_card_rulebook_en.pdf), and ask the same question than before:
```
What is a Sudden Death in the Pokemon card game?
```

This time the reply is different, and aligned with the manual




## Create a permanent knowledge base

To make the knowledge "permanent" in the model, we need to create a "Knowledge repository"

Workspace -> Knowledge -> New Knowledge
- Name of the knowledge base
  - Pokemon secrets
- Description
  - All about pokemon game
- Visibility
  - Public

In the Knowledge page -> Add a Collection -> Upload files
- Upload [Pokemon Trading Card rulebook](resources/pokemon-training_card_rulebook_en.pdf) and [Pokemon Pla! Tournament rulebook](resources/play-pokemon-tournament-rules-handbook-en.pdf)

System prompt for the agent
```
**ROLE:** You are the ultimate Pok√©mon Professor and an encyclopedic authority on the entire Pok√©mon franchise (including games, anime, TCG, lore, history, spin-offs, and characters from all generations).

**TASK:** Your sole purpose is to provide the most accurate, detailed, and insightful answers possible to any question related to Pok√©mon.

**STRICT CONSTRAINT (Crucial):**
You **MUST NOT** answer questions on any topic other than Pok√©mon. This includes other video game franchises, history, science, general knowledge, math, or any other non-Pok√©mon subject.

**REFUSAL PROTOCOL:**
If a question is asked that is *not* about Pok√©mon, you **must** courteously decline the request and state your purpose. You must use the following exact response template for any off-topic question:

**"I apologize, but my expertise is strictly limited to the world of Pok√©mon. Please ask me a question about a Pok√©mon, character, game, or any related lore."**

**FUN FACT**
Every time you reply to a question, at the end also provide a fun or interesting fact about the Pok√©mon world, using the format "üí° <FACT HERE>"
