# 04. Documents and RAG in Open WebUI


## What is RAG

https://docs.openwebui.com/features/rag/
- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a cutting-edge technology that enhances the conversational capabilities of chatbots by incorporating context from diverse sources. It works by retrieving relevant information from a wide range of sources such as local and remote documents, web content, and even multimedia sources like YouTube videos.
- The retrieved text is then combined with a predefined RAG template and prefixed to the user's prompt, providing a more informed and contextually relevant response.
- One of the key advantages of RAG is its ability to access and integrate information from a variety of sources, making it an ideal solution for complex conversational scenarios. For instance, when a user asks a question related to a specific document or web page, RAG can retrieve and incorporate the relevant information from that source into the chat response.
- Local documents must first be uploaded via the Documents section of the Workspace area to access them using the `#` symbol before a query. Click on the formatted URL in the that appears above the chat box. Once selected, a document icon appears above Send a message, indicating successful retrieval.
- You can also load documents into the workspace area with their access by starting a prompt with `#`, followed by a URL. This can help incorporate web content directly into your conversations.
- Citations in RAG Feature: the RAG feature allows users to easily track the context of documents fed to LLMs with added citations for reference points. This ensures transparency and accountability in the use of external sources within your chats.


https://docs.openwebui.com/features/rag/document-extraction/
- Document extraction refers to the process of automatically identifying and extracting text and data from various file formats, including PDFs (both text-based and scanned), Images containing text, Handwritten documents, etc.
- Document extraction is essential for transforming unstructured document content into structured data that can be effectively used by language models.




## Passing a document to provide context

Create a new chat with a model like gemma3:4b or qwen3:8b.  

Ask simple questions on Pokemon Trading card game, like
```
What are the energies in the Pokemon card game?

What is a Sudden Death in the Pokemon card game?
```

As you can see, the model knows how to play Pokemon.

But a Sudden Death is something different, and defined in page 21 of the [Pokemon Trading Card rulebook](resources/pokemon-training_card_rulebook_en.pdf).


In the prompt, upload the [Pokemon Trading Card rulebook](resources/pokemon-training_card_rulebook_en.pdf), and ask the same question than before:
```
What is a Sudden Death in the Pokemon card game?
```

This time the reply is different, and aligned with the manual




## Create a permanent knowledge base

To make the knowledge "permanent" in the model, we need to create a "Knowledge repository"

Workspace -> Knowledge -> New Knowledge
- Name of the knowledge base
  - Pokemon secrets
- Description
  - All about pokemon game
- Visibility
  - Public

Now files can be accessed everywhere using the `#` in the prompt.


In the Knowledge page -> Add a Collection -> Upload files
- Upload [Pokemon Trading Card rulebook](resources/pokemon-training_card_rulebook_en.pdf) and [Pokemon Pla! Tournament rulebook](resources/play-pokemon-tournament-rules-handbook-en.pdf)

System prompt for the agent
```
**ROLE:** You are the ultimate Pok√©mon Professor and an encyclopedic authority on the entire Pok√©mon franchise (including games, anime, TCG, lore, history, spin-offs, and characters from all generations).

**TASK:** Your sole purpose is to provide the most accurate, detailed, and insightful answers possible to any question related to Pok√©mon.

**STRICT CONSTRAINT (Crucial):**
You **MUST NOT** answer questions on any topic other than Pok√©mon. This includes other video game franchises, history, science, general knowledge, math, or any other non-Pok√©mon subject.

**REFUSAL PROTOCOL:**
If a question is asked that is *not* about Pok√©mon, you **must** courteously decline the request and state your purpose. You must use the following exact response template for any off-topic question:

**"I apologize, but my expertise is strictly limited to the world of Pok√©mon. Please ask me a question about a Pok√©mon, character, game, or any related lore."**

**FUN FACT**
Every time you reply to a question, at the end also provide a fun or interesting fact about the Pok√©mon world, using the format "üí° <FACT HERE>"
