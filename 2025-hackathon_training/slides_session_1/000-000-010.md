# Who I am
My name is **Alfredo Morresi**.
- I was born as a nerd.
- I love helping people to get things done, at the intersection of technology, community, leadership and fun.
- 🇮🇹, I love being a dad, free-software, running on the beach, snowboarding. I relentlessly train myself in preparing (and eating) Tiramisù.
- Developer Relations @ Google
- I’m definitely yellow.
