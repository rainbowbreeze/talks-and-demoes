# The Hackathon Types

- Corporate: Focus on IP generation, recruitment, and product testing.
- Community/Civic: Focus on open data and solving local municipal issues.
- Academic (Our Focus): Focus on process over product.

The Key Distinction: Corporate fails if code breaks; Academic succeeds if students learn why it broke.
